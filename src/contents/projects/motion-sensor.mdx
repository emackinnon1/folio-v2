## Project Overview

This project was borne from a lack of bump sensor products that would integrate with my phone or with Home Assistant. I wanted something to put on my motorcycle to know if
the cover was lifted or if the motorcycle was bumped. A couple of iterations later, I settled on a transmitter of a ESP-WROOM-32 with code in C++ powered by a LiPo battery running with an MPU-6050, an HC-12, an LC709203F,
a BQ24074 and optional solar panels. The ESP wakes up on an interrupt signal from the MPU or at an adjustable interval to take the battery voltage reading, and sends this data off to a receiver that runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico
running a bit of microphython with an HC12 used to receive signals that uses WiFi to dispatch relevant MQTT messages to Home Assistant. I would like to take this a little further still and shrink the form factor by
creating a PCB and using a SIM to have this bump sensor work anywhere I go, not just in the immediate vicinity of the receiver. Integrating GPS might be a great addition as well.

### List of Materials

The minimum things you will need to get a bump sensor working are an MPU6050 and an ESP32. If you don't plan on using a battery with it, you don't need much else.
For the version I built, you will need the following:

- ESP32: I used an ESP-WROOM-32 dev board since they're cheap. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WCG1PLV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&th=1)
- Raspberry Pi Pico w: Used for the receiver. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09437S9X4?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k1_1_9&amp=&crid=3ADO09OI5QC9G&amp=&sprefix=raspberry)
- MPU6050: Amazon has these for cheap. [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LP25V1A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)
- HC-12: These are also low cost on Amazon, you'll need two.

- LC709203F: Adafruit makes a ton of neat modules, and this is one of them. [Adafruit link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4712)
- BQ24074: if you plan on either using solar panels or want an easy way to charge the battery, this is a good idea. [Adafruit link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4755?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrKu2BhDkARIsAD7GBosD9G0SplaXmfB-4p6MjDxxLmAb3Q-fm4WGqoM28mGtt_ind25ea8caAkumEALw_wcB)
- LiPo battery: I used quite big batteries, but if you reduce your power consumption you should be fine with smaller batteries. [Amazon link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4755?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrKu2BhDkARIsAD7GBosD9G0SplaXmfB-4p6MjDxxLmAb3Q-fm4WGqoM28mGtt_ind25ea8caAkumEALw_wcB)

- Typical other supplies: wiring, soldering iron, solder, prototyping circuit board, back off screws, etc

## Wiring

### Receiver

The Raspberry Pi Pico receiver is the easiest part to set up. You will need to solder the HC12 to some wires and connect the wires to the appropriate pins on the pico. Since the HC12 is the only peripheral, I didn't bother even soldering
the HC12 directly to it and instead used female jumper cables to establish the connection to the right pins, then soldered those to the HC12. I wanted to be able to reuse the Pico (the better option would be to just solder pins to the
HC12 and have female jumper cables connecting the two, so reuse of both is possible). The picture at the top shows of this blog post shows the Pico/HC12 wiring. The RX/TX pins are 5 and 4, respectively, and the VIN and GND
should be connected to the Pico's 3.3V and GND pins.

### Transmitter

The wiring for the transmitter has a little more going on, but it still isn't all that complex.

The main components are the MPU and the HC-12, both wired to share the VCC 3.3V and GND connections. The LC709203F also shares this circuit. After that, the correct pins should be connected to their respective modules to
communicate with the ESP32. The SCL and SDA pins on the MPU6050 should be connected to GPIO22 and GPIO21, respectively. The MPU's INT pin should be connected to GPIO35. On the HC12, the TX should be connected to the
ESP32's GPIO16 and the HC12's RX should be connected to GPIO17 on the ESP32. For the LC709203F, the SCL on it should be wired to the GPIO32 on the ESP and SDA should be wired to GPIO33. Side note: the LC709203F and the MPU6050
_should_ be able to exist on a single I2C bus, but since these were the only two peripherals connected using I2C, I just got lazy and connected them to separate sets of pins.

The battery should be connected to the BQ24074. There are labels on the silk screen that tell you which terminal is positive and which is negative (off brand batteries might have the polarity reversed, use your multimeter!).
The "LOAD OUT" (printed on the silk screen) should lead to the LC709203F. These do not have a direction that the power needs to flow, so either JST connector can be used here. After that, the power needs to flow to the
buck converter, which should be at 5v, and then to the VIN and GND pins of the ESP32. If you get the buck converter that has a potentiometer, use a multimeter with the battery hooked up to it to figure out where 5V is.

## Interfacing Transmitter, Receiver and MQTT/Home Assistant

I will run through an explanation of the interactions between the components at a high level and talk about more specifics of the code. The overall flow of information goes like:

```
ESP32 sends signal via HC12 ->
Pico Receiver receives signal via HC12 ->
Pico Receiver decodes the signal and dispatches a payload to an MQTT topic ->
Payload is received on an MQTT server running on Home Assistant
```

The code can be found in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/emackinnon1/transmitter_receiver_hc_12).

The `battery_gauge_test.ino` was for testing the LC709203F and the I2C connection. I went ahead and left it in there if anyone else has a little trouble in the beginning, but you have to have a battery
plugged into the LC709203F in order to get the I2C address read by the ESP32 (which I later found out). There are two sections of code (the bottom section is commented out), one which sets up the LC709203F and the other
tests the I2C address on the I2C circuit.

The next file, `central_receiver.py` is for the Pico that does the receiving of signals. There are probably a hundred better ways to build a low bitrate signaling protocol (the code could also do with some cleaning up
while we're at it), but I threw it together on the fly. You will see a [dict](https://github.com/emackinnon1/transmitter_receiver_hc_12/blob/main/central_receiver.py#L18-L29) that holds information that determines
how to interpret messages from the transmitter and determine what to pass on in a payload to the MQTT server. Right now, there is one base key of `1`. The idea was to have other sensors that might be utilizing the
same receiver, so when there was another message that came in, say from a weather sensor, `2` would be its domain and it would have corresponding topics and messages. The shortcoming of this approach is obviously that
the transmitters need to know this dictionary's structure, but the nice thing is that it simplifies and shortens the messages sent (it will look something like: `1,A,b`), which means more reliability and lower chances
of signal interference.

When I set up this whole system, I fully intended the Movement Detected/No Movement signals and state to come from the transmitter and the receiver was going to be stateless. However, once I started messing around with trying to
put the transmitter in deep sleep, it meant keeping state and coordinating from the receiver or Home Assistant was tricky. When the transmitter is asleep, no reset signals can be processed by it. I moved a poorly thought-out  
coordination of state into the receiver. As you can see [here](https://github.com/emackinnon1/transmitter_receiver_hc_12/blob/main/central_receiver.py#L31-L33), there is a `cmd_topic` dict that has an MQTT topic that serves as
a way for Home Assistant to tell the receiver to do something. The topics in that dict are registered to listen to and these [lines](https://github.com/emackinnon1/transmitter_receiver_hc_12/blob/main/central_receiver.py#L62-L64)
show where, upon reception of a message on any cmd topic, the corresponding key for that topic is immediately dispatched to my Home Assistant MQTT server. I admit, it isn't the best way to do this; I think doing away with
this pattern altogether and simply housing state in whatever end system you use to display the results of the motion transmitter is the right move. Simply let the transmitter serve as a push provider. Future iterations will
have this worked out.

The `motion_transmitter.ino` file contains all the code for the ESP32 transmitter. This looks pretty different from the Pico transmitter code (in `movement_transmitter.py`) because there is no comparison from the last reading
going on. It uses the INT signal going low from the MPU upon movement to send data to the receiver. Every three hours (change the number of seconds [here](https://github.com/emackinnon1/transmitter_receiver_hc_12/blob/main/motion_transmitter.ino#L31)
if you would like a different interval) the battery percentage is read and sent.

The `movement_transmitter.py` contains the micropython code that ran the first iteration of the transmitter. It ran similarly to the ESP32 version except the pico was awoken every 3 seconds from `lightsleep` and readings from the
LC709203F and MPU6050 were taken. This was way less efficient for the battery. Addtionally, the movement type is also transmitted ("Pitch" or "Acceleration").

Right now, I have the battery percentage, the motion sensor state, and the motion sensor receiver status as sensors in Home Assistant. The motion sensor movement type was also used at one point, but since moving everything to
the ESP32, that part is unneeded now (I still included it in the yaml files in case you want it). The yaml code that sets everything up is included in the `/home_assistant` directory in the GitHub repo.

## Wrap Up

This, like other projects I have done, not only fulfilled an actual need I had (knowing if someone was messing with my motorcycle) but also was a great learning experience. I got to learn more about using an interrupt signal
to wake up an ESP32, good strategies for battery efficiency (ESP32s will now be my go-to microcontroller for battery-operated projects because of their deep sleep wakeup functionality), and how to communicate over distances
if WiFi isn't an option. On the communication over distances note, there was something I discovered well after I was into the building phase of this project that would have helped me out:
[ESP-NOW](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp-now-esp32-arduino-ide/). This will be a future consideration for similar projects as it is a robust solution that I wouldn't have to build from scratch like I did with the
HC12s, transmitter/receiver and custom code approach.

As with any project, I am already thinking of ways I could do things better and would like to be able to use this even if I am out of range of the receiver, so I am going to create a version with the
[Lilygo T-SIM7000G](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-sim7000g?srsltid=AfmBOopSajrMrj6fJ1umMDnZ3NmX0KUQpsPLoP-0Jpd3wPqS-r6rXfEx) board. This will let me utilize a cell network and free me from the chains of needing to be in
same general area to know if someone bumped my motorcycle. The added benefit is that I will be able to use GPS, too! I am really excited to give this a shot.
