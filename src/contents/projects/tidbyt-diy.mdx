If you're familiar with [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/), you know just how great
of a product it is. The group of engineers who built the product are awesome, so
it was unsurprising that another company
[snapped them up](https://tidbyt.com/blogs/tidbyt/tidbyt-is-joining-modal?srsltid=AfmBOorQMUiwm4YpVtTMcSK7aZSDvUyKm0K4U_AHwvBODOPYDgzb2Xbo). 
Unfortunately, this meant that the Tidbyt was discontinued indefinitely.

This development left me with the task of figuring out how to get a new Tidbyt.
Luckily, I have been dabbling with a number of things that made the notion of
making a DIY version not so implausible: microcontrollers, servers running on my
local network, Raspberry Pis, and 3D printing. In this post, I will go over how
I was able to build a DIY version (albeit a less professional-looking, yet 
servicable one) of a Tidbyt. At the end, I'll share some future iterations that
I would like to implement.

## Supply list

- [Adafruit Matrix Portal - CircuitPython Powered Internet Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745)
  - Get a HUB75 board and power supply from Adafruit while you are at it, you'll save yourself a few headaches with faulty products.
- Raspberry Pi: I used a Model 4b, but you might be able to use a 5. You'd need
  to be sure that everything (mainly the pixlet binary) works on a 5.
- Optional: [3D printed case](http://thingiverse.com/thing:5377229) which you
  will need to fit to the mm pitch of your matrix, which you should be able to
  do by measuring your matrix panel and scaling the object in your respective 3D
  printing software.
- Optional:
  [3D printed stand](https://makerworld.com/en/models/934312-adjustable-picture-photo-frame-stand?from=search#profileId-898859)
  that you can use this to stand up the 3D-printed case

## Code

You'll need some code:

- [Axilla](https://github.com/emackinnon1/axilla)
- [HDK](https://github.com/emackinnon1/adafruit-matrixportal-s3-hdk)

## Setup of the Raspberry Pi

### Initial setup

You'll need to get the Raspberry Pi set up. I won't include the steps for that
here, but consult google for setting up an OS on a Raspberry Pi. I'd recommend
the official Raspberry Pi OS since they've recently added Raspberry Pi Connect,
which lets you connect to any of your Pis over an internet connection. This
means you won't have to have a physical screen and keyboard connected all the
time and can develop remotely once your Pi is connected to the internet.

During the setup, be sure to set a hostname for you Raspberry Pi. This will make
it easier when we use the Adafruit matrix portal to send requests for the webp
images. If you're interested, here is a
[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/vdc94s/raspberry_pi_and_local_host_name/)
that talks about the service allowing your Pi to be discoverable as
`{hostname}.local` on your local network. There are plenty of articles explaining how 
to set this up on the interwebs, but you can also do it during the initial burning 
of the OS image with Raspberry Pi Imager if you find the "Advanced Options" before burning.

### Install pixlet

This should fully be explained in the repo, but you will need to install the
[pixlet binary](https://tidbyt.dev/docs/build/installing-pixlet) using the
linux_arm64 version. It was a while ago when I did this, so the details are a
little fuzzy, but I remember struggling with it a bit. That was also when pixlet
was first being ported over to `linux_arm64` by the open source community, so there 
were a few wrinkles being worked out. I'll include a link to
[instructions to build the binary](https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet/blob/main/docs/BUILD.md),
too.

To directly install the binary, there are a few simple steps. Before running these
commands, I believe you will want to ensure that node, go, and libwebp are all
installed on your Raspberry Pi. If you run into problems, there are a few
[forum threads](https://discuss.tidbyt.com/t/pixlet-install-on-linux-raspberrypi/240)
that might be helpful to poke around.

```bash
# Download the archive.
curl -LO https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet/releases/download/v0.34.0/pixlet_0.34.0_linux_arm64.tar.gz

# Unpack the archive.
tar -xvf pixlet_0.34.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz

# Ensure the binary is executable.
chmod +x ./pixlet

# Move the binary into your path.
sudo mv pixlet /usr/local/bin/pixlet
```

Run the following to be sure everything is working, you should see a list of
subcommands:

```bash
pixlet -h
```

### Axilla

Once you get your Pi set up, you'll need to clone the axilla repo mentioned in
the "Code" section at the top of the article with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emackinnon1/axilla
```

I forked this repo over from
[btjones/axilla](https://github.com/btjones/axilla), which is a service
originally set up to run on Netlify (and under the hood, AWS Lambda). You'll
have to excuse the state of my repo as I only made the changes necessary to set
it up as a node server, run some scripts and serve local Starlink files. Feel
free to fork it and clean it up as you see fit.

Btjones's original repo has steps to set it up and go the Netlify route (which
is very low effort). However, if you're like me, you don't want to spend money
to host a simple app like this if you can help it.

As mentioned, I made a few changes from the original axilla repo, with the main one
being that I directly run files saved in the codebase instead of using the
tactic of passing in a url of a Starlark app thats code is publicly available.
You'll need to use the `fileName` param along with whatever params are
needed for a particular app. Here is an example of generating the `digital_rain` applet
when running on `localhost:3000`:

```
http://localhost:3000/?fileName=digital_rain&format=webp&output=image
```

These built-in applets running in my axilla version follow a specific folder
structure:

```
functions/axilla/assets/
  applet_name/
    applet_name.star
```

Each applet has its own folder inside the `assets` directory, and the Starlark
file name must match the folder name. When you include the param
`fileName=digital_rain` in the URL, Axilla looks for the file in the top
directory. For example:

```
functions/axilla/assets/
  digital_rain/
    digital_rain.star
  starfield/
    starfield.star
```

The pixlet binary includes a few subcommands that allow you to conveniently test
out individual apps locally. I have found that is the easiest to figure out what
params to pass in as there is a nice little UI that includes every param option.
Try it out yourself by running the following after you have an app saved in the
repo.

```bash
pixlet serve pixlet serve functions/axilla/assets/digital_rain/digital_rain.star
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and you should see your app running. Fill
out whatever parameters or options you want. You'll notice that these
automatically get added to the url, which you can then copy for use in the HDK
code later on. Alternatively, you can go into the actual Starlark code and
hardcode whatever options you want (look for `schema.Option` in the code).

### Running the app

To get this app running, you can test it out by running the scripts. I included
a script to test this app out on a Mac which you can try out by running
`./macos-start.sh` in your terminal.

When you get around to downloading and running this on a Raspberry Pi, we'll
have to get a few things out of the way first. Consult this
[tutorial](https://dev.to/bogdaaamn/run-your-nodejs-application-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi-4jnn)
on running and serving a node.js app on your local network for more detailed
information, but you'll want to open up the firewall settings to allow traffic
on port 3000 and be sure `pm2` is installed globally.

You should have node.js already installed from setting up pixlet, but now you
will want to run the following:

```bash
# Install PM2
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Confirm the installation worked
pm2 -v
```

In the tutorial I linked above, the author shows you how to add a `pm2` script
that will start this app when the Pi boots up.

After that, we'll get port 3000 open to incoming traffic. The _right_ way to do
that is with Nginx or another reverse proxy for security and other reasons, so
if you want to not be sloppy and lazy, follow the steps to set up
[Nginx](https://dev.to/bogdaaamn/run-your-nodejs-application-on-a-headless-raspberry-pi-4jnn#:~:text=in%20your%20browser.-,1.%20Install%20NGINX,-I%20used%20Nginx)
(under the section titled "1. Install NGINX"). Otherwise, you can quickly set up
your Pi to allow traffic by running the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ufw

sudo ufw allow ssh

sudo ufw enable

sudo ufw allow 3000
```

After that, run the start script (making sure to pass in the `NODE_ENV`) and
confirm the `pm2` daemon is running.

```bash
# Run this
NODE_ENV=production ./start.sh

# You should see something like this in the script's output
┌──────────┬────┬─────────┬──────┬─────┬────────┬─────────┬────────┬──────┬───────────┬──────┬──────────┐
│ App name │ id │ version │ mode │ pid │ status │ restart │ uptime │ cpu  │ mem       │ user │ watching │
├──────────┼────┼─────────┼──────┼─────┼────────┼─────────┼────────┼──────┼───────────┼──────┼──────────┤
│ app      │ 0  │ N/A     │ fork │ 451 │ online │ 0       │ 96m    │ 0.2% │ 31.8 MB   │ pi   │ disabled │
└──────────┴────┴─────────┴──────┴─────┴────────┴─────────┴────────┴──────┴───────────┴──────┴──────────┘
```

Now, for the final step of the Pi setup, get on another computer and try to
navigate to the app using a browser. Use the hostname that you set up way back
when you got the Pi's OS loaded, so something like this:

```
http://hostname.local:3000/?fileName=digital_rain&format=webp&output=image
```

Hopefully, you should see a small webp image in your browser!

Eventually, I plan on moving over to Nginx to eliminate the need to add the
":3000" to the end of the hostname and to route traffic more efficiently, but
for now I simply have ufw enabling ingress traffic.

## Set up LED matrix and Adafruit Matrix Portal

We're going to need to set up the Adafruit Matrix Portal now. This is also a
forked repo (it is the Hardware Development Kit from the brilliant engineers
over at Tidbyt), so you'll have to excuse any ugly code. Like the axilla repo
fork, I only changed the things that I need to get this up and running.

You'll need the Platform IO VS Code extension installed and a usb-c cord to
connect the Adafruit Matrix Portal to your machine. The repo's
[README](https://github.com/emackinnon1/adafruit-matrixportal-s3-hdk) should
have all the information you need to get going, but essentially you'll be
cloning the repo down, setting up a `secrets.h` header file in the `/src` dir,
and setting up some macros and const variables.

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash

# Clone the repo to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/emackinnon1/adafruit-matrixportal-s3-hdk

# cd into the repo
cd adafruit-matrixportal-s3-hdk

# create the secrets file
touch src/secrets.h
```

Inside the `secrets.h` file, add the following:

```c
#define TIDBYT_WIFI_SSID "your wifi ssid"
#define TIDBYT_WIFI_PASSWORD "your wifi password"

# This is the base url that we will send requests to
const char* BASE_URL = "http://yourpihostname.local:3000";

# These are going to be the apps that you have added to your axilla instance
# These are a few of mine
const char* APPLET_PARAMS[] = {
  "/?fileName=date_progress&show_day=true&show_month=true&show_year=true&show_labels=true&show_values=true&color_year=%230ff&color_month=%230f0&color_day=%23f00&start_hour=0&start_minute=0&end_hour=0&end_minute=0",
  "/?fileName=yearprogress&color=%2347a"
}
```

When you have this all set up, connect the Matrix Portal to your HUB75 (you may
want to consult
[Adafruit's docs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4)) and use
Platform IO to upload the code to the portal. You can either use the terminal:

```bash
pio run --environment adafruit_matrixportal_esp32s3 --target upload
```

Or use the Platform IO extension and click `Upload` (click Monitor to print the
output of your code to the terminal):

With the axilla code running on your Pi, the HDK code running on Matrix Portal
and both connected to the same network, you should see pixlet-generated images
on the LED matrix!

The last thing you can do is print out the case and stand (links are at the top
of this article) if you have a 3D printer. Adafruit includes screws that you can
use to attach the case to the LED matrix with.

## Future improvements

This project required learning some things that I wasn't all that familiar with:
namely hosting/exposing apps on local networks, C language, and Platform IO.
While I am happy to have things working for now, I would like to make some
future improvements.

Adding a database would open up a lot of functionality. I would like to build an
endpoint returns the list of loaded apps, designate apps as "active" and
"inactive", and allow the uploading and deleting of apps without having to
manually upload code to the axilla repo and the HDK every time I want to add
something new. Instead, I could simply manage my pixlet apps with a UI running
on the Pi and subsequently alter the HDK code to request the list of current
apps from the appropriate endpoint, displaying them afterward. If I go this
route, I will also have to think about how I can maintain the params for each
app, which will take some thinking.

There is another application that runs pixlet apps:
https://github.com/DouweM/pixbyt. It works very differently, leveraging Docker
instead of node.js. It also integrates with the official Tidbyt platform to send
apps to an real Tidbyt if you have one of those in your possession. This might
offer a more seamless integration between DIY Tidbyts and real ones, but I have
yet to explore how I could implement it.
