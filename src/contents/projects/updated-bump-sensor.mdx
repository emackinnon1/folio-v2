The previous iteration of this
<a className='mt-2' href='/projects/updating-bump-sensor'>
  project
</a>
was a _very_ DIY-looking project. I used some large electrical junction boxes and
jerry rigged everything to my motorcycle.

Rather than look like I am riding around with homemade explosives on my
motorcycle, I cleaned up the form factor a lot more:

    height={350}
  />
</div>

The other thing I did was attach an external button to disable the MPU6050,
meaning I don't have to open up the box and flip the switch of the Lilygo
anymore when I want to ride around (otherwise the MPU constantly goes off from
the motion of the ride).

Normally the INT drops to a logical 0 (low) to signal a change in motion or
position. The new circuit uses a diode, a 10K resistor and a toggle button to
hold the INT signal from the MPU to a logical 1 (high) when the circuit is
closed, preventing the drop to a low.

With this I used some
[metal brackets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09P5BS72Q?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_4&th=1)
and some
[clamps](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BC6DYJG?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2&th=1)
to attach the junction box with everything stuffed in it to the pannier rack.
