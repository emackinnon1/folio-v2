## Explanation of project

This project runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico sharing a serial connection with an
Arduino Uno. The bones of this project were taken from another tutorial that
uses 2 Arduino Unos, one running the lightning animation logic and another
running logic to receive the IR signal and pass it along via I2C protocol.
Having built the 2 Arduino version first, I thought I might be able to improve
on it and control this via MQTT and Home Assistant. I kept most of the code from
the Arduino Uno driving the led strip, but altered it slightly to read bytes
from the pico on a Tx/Rx connection instead of another Uno via I2C connection.

The relevant project instructions for the original 2 Arduino lightning cloud and
such are
[here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/build-cloud-lamp-sound-reactive-lightning/);
this is a great project to get started with if the micropython, MQTT, Home
Assistant, etc portions aren't necessary for you. Either way, it's a good idea
to read through those instructions so you can get an idea of how you want to
create the cloud and any of the background info that I may have overlooked while
writing this post. You can, as I did, take this project in a few different
directions: you could make this into a ceiling feature, a hanging lamp, or any
number of other configurations. I also stuck some noodle LEDs on this to make a
sort of "lightning" that flashes as you can see in the gif of the cloud at the
top of this article.

Additional supplies:

- 5v 10a power supply Jumper cables
- Electrical box to house wires and parts
- Material to make actual cloud and structure (mine is made using this
  [bell jar display](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MMWS5BT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)).
  Depends on how you want to make it but could include:
  - Polyester Fiber fill
  - Spray glue (holds the polyster fibers together)
  - Steel wire (provides foundation for cloud shape; I used a cage of this to
    hold the polyester and LED strip)
  - styrofoam (if you follow the linked tutorial's idea)
  - micro usb cable for pico power

## Getting started and code explanation

You'll want to first plan out how you are going to construct the cloud. This
will influence the rest of your materials like the number of LEDs you use,
whether or not you want the sound module (this is in the original lightning
cloud project on makeuseof.com), if you want to include the LED noodle for the
lightning bolts, etc.

As with many of my project write ups, this is being written post-completion, so
I unfortunately do not have pictures of the in-progress steps. You can see the
final product in the gif above and some of the menu functionality here:

To set up the pico for this project, there is a great guide that Pimonori has
put together
[here](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-pico) that will
take you from installing the firmware to installing the best IDE for
micropython, Thonny. If you already know how to do all of this and just want the
firmware, you can head over to the
[pimonori github repo](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico?tab=readme-ov-file)
or browse the releases of the firmware
[here](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico/releases). To use the pimonori
display pack, you have to flash the pico With the right firmware (it will have
all the relevant methods built in), which should be the pico W version of the
firmware.

The pico should be put on the GPIO expander (listed in the materials for this
project). This will allow you to have the display pack along with access to the
GPIO pins. Some pins are used by the display pack and you will have to avoid
those in order for it to function properly, but sticking to the pins I have used
should keep you safe here. The basic idea is that the menu is used to select the
mode of the lightning cloud. Once a new mode is selected via the menu, two
things happen: the mode selection is sent in bytes over a serial connection to
the Arduino UNO, and the selection is also sent via MQTT to an MQTT server on
the state topic.

The pico code that sets up the menu, handles the MQTT pub/sub pieces, and sends
the bytes over serial is located in this
[file](https://github.com/emackinnon1/lightning_cloud_with_display/blob/main/main.py).
The B and Y buttons are used to move the highlighted selection up and down while
the A and X buttons are used to select a mode.

Looking into the
[Arduino Uno code](https://github.com/emackinnon1/lightning_cloud_with_display/blob/main/lightning_lamp.ino)
shows that is a pretty straightforward state machine. It processes the incoming
bytes from the serial connection with the pico W and sets a `mode`. In the
`loop()` function, the `mode` is set in the `receiveEvent()` call, and directly
after that the `mode` is passed through a switch statement to call the correct
function to control the LED strip.

One side note is that there is a
[simple function](https://github.com/emackinnon1/lightning_cloud_with_display/blob/main/lightning_lamp.ino#L59-L62)
that controls the LED "lightning" noodles, in my version. I controlled two LED
noodles with one dual output mosfet, but I want to go back and control the two
noodles separately, giving a bit more dynamism to the overall effect. This
function is where you can add more output pins for controlling more than one
noodle.

## Home Assistant Integration

This project was made so I could control it via my Home Assistant instance. To
do that, I had to connect the pico W to my wifi, set up an MQTT server (I have a
Mosquito instance running on Home Assistant), and create some automations and
helpers to string it all together.

The first thing you'll want to do is create an `input_select` helper in Home
Assistant (seen below) that will represent the lightning cloud lamp's state. You
will want to make sure the members of this input select _exactly match_ the
options of the pico menu.

  alt='input select helper'

  height={550}
  aspect={{ width: 1, height: 1 }}
/>

After this is created, you will want to create an automation that does two
things:

1. Upon the changing of this helper's state, it sends a message to the
   `cmd/lightning_cloud/mode` topic for the lightning cloud lamp
2. When the state is changed directly from the pico menu, a message will be sent
   to the `state/lightning_cloud/mode` topic. Every time this happens, the
   helper should match its state to the payload received on this topic.

The automation I created to do this can be found
[here](https://github.com/emackinnon1/lightning_cloud_with_display/blob/main/lightning_cloud_lamp_state_hass_automation.yaml).

## Summary

All in all, this is a really fun project to make and is a fun conversation piece
when people come over. If I owned my own home, I would have made a larger, more
[permamanent fixture](https://www.tiktok.com/@thatsjustjessiee/video/7126391426992196907).
It was a fun exercise to learn more about I2C (not used in this project but used
in the original tutorial on makeuseof) and serial connections. Things I might do
differently might be to clean up the box I used to hold the pico W menu as it
was a little messy and not having two LED noodles controlled by a single MOSFET
would be ideal for a little variability in that feature.

I would love to hear feedback on this write up and project, so if you have any
questions or comments feel free to find me on any of my socials that are linked
