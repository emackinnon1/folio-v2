## Explanation of project

This project runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico sharing a serial connection with an Arduino Uno. The bones of this project
were taken from another project that uses 2 Arduino Unos, one running the lightning logic an IR remote and another
running logic to receive the IR signal and send it along using I2C protocol. Having built this version first, I thought
I might be able to improve on it and control this via MQTT and home assistant. I mostly left the physical structure and
code from the Arduino Uno driving the led strip, but altered it slightly to read bytes from the pico on a Tx/Rx connection
instead of another Uno via I2C connection.

The relevant project instructions are for the lightning cloud and such are [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/build-cloud-lamp-sound-reactive-lightning/).
It's a good idea to read through the instructions so you can get an idea of how you want to create the cloud. You could make this
into a ceiling feature, a hanging lamp, or any number of other configurations. I also stuck some noodle LEDs on this to make a
sort of "lightning" that flashes.
