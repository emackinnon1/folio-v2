## Explanation of project

The previous [iteration of this project](/projects/motion-sensor) was bound to
distances of less than 1 KM because the HC-12, while extremely useful for
sending simple, low bitrate serial data, was not going to allow me to know if
someone bumped into my motorcycle while parked somewhere that wasn't within the
range. This Lilygo T-Sim7000g module gives the functionality of an ESP32 with a
SIM7000G chip, allowing you to make requests over mobile networks. More info
about the pinouts and details can be found in articles like
[these](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/lilygo-t-sim7000g-esp32-lte-gprs-gps/).
I used mine with an MPU6050 to allow for a notification to be sent to my phone
from home assistant when my motorcycle is bumped while out and about.

### Supply list

- [Lilygo T-Sim7000g](https://www.lilygo.cc/en-pl/products/t-sim7000g?srsltid=AfmBOopCDDR9SqL6_LpWweL-p6BrUHF4FsLO8fOUN2q282IJ-ty6Kr5G).
  Amazon also has them in America.
- SIM card. I got one from [Hologram](https://www.hologram.io/) and it was super

## Setting up SIM and testing code

My code can be found here:
https://github.com/emackinnon1/lilygo-bump-GPS/blob/main/lilygo_bump_GPS.ino

This is largely based on the code found in this article under the section
titled:
[LILYGO T-SIM7000G ESP32: Connect to the Internet, Send SMS, and Get GPS Data](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/lilygo-t-sim7000g-esp32-lte-gprs-gps/#:~:text=LILYGO%20T%2DSIM7000G%20ESP32%3A%20Connect%20to%20the%20Internet%2C%20Send%20SMS%2C%20and%20Get%20GPS%20Data).
I also used the relevants parts of this code that
[sends data to Traccar](https://github.com/onlinegill/LILYGO-TTGO-T-SIM7000G-ESP32-Traccar-GPS-tracker/blob/main/traccar.ino).

You will want to get your SIM card set up first and test this near a window or
outside for good service. Uncomment
[these lines with test server and resources](https://github.com/emackinnon1/lilygo-bump-GPS/blob/main/lilygo_bump_GPS.ino#L49-L52)
and comment out
[these lines](https://github.com/emackinnon1/lilygo-bump-GPS/blob/main/lilygo_bump_GPS.ino#L43-L44)
in order to try out making http requests. You can comment out the other lines
setting up the MPU while you are testing as well.

The other
[major part of the code that contains an http call](https://github.com/emackinnon1/lilygo-bump-GPS/blob/main/lilygo_bump_GPS.ino#L189-L231)
is making a call to my Traccar server, which I set up to track GPS location.
Traccar has an integration with Home Assistant that makes everything very easy.

## Wiring

The wiring on this module is fairly simple since the only peripherals wired to
the board are an MPU6050 and a relay. The relay should have a 12v A23 battery on
it and the buzzer. I broke up the MPU and alarms into their own separate modules
which made the form factor more manageable. You can use electrical glands to run
the wires into the different boxes and velcro to attach everything to whatever
it is you are using this system on.

For the MPU, the SCL and SDA to GPIO 22 and GPIO 21 respectively. After that you
just need a wire for 3.3V and GND and one connected to GPIO 32 for an INT signal
to wakeup the board. The relay is pretty straightforward, connect one end to the
other ground pin, one to the other 3v3 pin and one to a GPIO (I used 33).

It's optional, but you can also use a solar panel to charge the battery. I did
this and used the solar power manager. The nice part about the power manager is
it tops ou your capacity to a quadruple factor with three more 18650 batteries
and you can use whatever solar panel you want even if the voltage is higher than
the recommended 6v. It does require a little more space inside the electrical
box, so you may want to see if that will work for your uses.

As mentioned in the beginning, this was the iteration I wanted to make after I
made my first [motion sensor](/projects/motion-sensor). MPU6050 modules are
extremely useful for motion or vibration detection and now that I can combine
them with this Lilygo T-SIM7000g, I can send data untethered from a wifi
connection or point-to-point communication protocol.

A few of the drawbacks of this iteration are the slow up time (the previous
iteration with HC-12s pinged my phone in a matter of seconds that the motion
sensor was bumped). It takes about a full minute to connect to the hologram
network and send updates via http requests, not counting the the GPS calculation
and upload, which could be upwards of 15 minutes. I ended up removing the GPS
portion of the code because it took so long and I moved the battery logging to
Home Assistant. I may redo this project yet again if there is an available 5G
solution, but a board or module with this capability seems to be hard-to-find as
of now. One other piece about boards is that there is an
[MCU based around Nordic Semi's nRF9160](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4753)
with an accelerometer built in as well as a bunch of other features that are
extendable with the [FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/category/945) line of
products from Adafruit.

The last thing I wish I could change is the form factor. I was able to break
things up into more three small electrical boxes, but... It is still a _very_
DIY-looking project.
