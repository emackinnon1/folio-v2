Freedom hides a snake in the grass.

Inherent in the concept of it is a contradiction: unchecked freedom means I am
free to limit others' freedom. _True_ free markets have no rules against hiring
a hitman against your market competition. Karl Popper extended the logic with
his [Paradox of Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance):
society tolerating the intolerable leads to a society of intolerance, as the
intolerant don't tolerate the tolerant. Democracy suffers this paradox of
limits, as a true democracy lets a majority vote to reduce the rights of the
minority, or simply vote in an authoritarian tyrant (huh, wonder how that notion
might be relevant in America today...).

I recently read an excellent article in the Atlantic on the loss of America's
unique freedom of movement over the last 50 years, the ramifications of which
are quite keenly felt today, yet which are seemingly mislabeled as and
misattributed to "housing shortages", "wage stagnation" and "hollowing out of
the middle class". The
[article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/03/american-geographic-social-mobility/681439/)
is worth the read, as is the book it talks about (Yoni Appelbaum’s _Stuck: How
the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity_),
but lurking in the shadows of this analysis of reduced American mobility was a
subtle rendition of the paradox of democracy. To use the article's pithy
summation: "A nation that had grown diverse and prosperous by allowing people to
choose their communities would instead empower communities to choose their
people." A self-interested group of urbanists collared the open systems of
mobility that they _themselves_ benefitted from, statically preserving their own
interests over the benefits such a system visits upon all. The current name for
this movement is NIMBYism, an especially pernicious political phenomenon given
that most its purveyors subscribe to ideals in direct opposition: those of
inclusion and social equality.

These subtle paradoxes litter our political world.

Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was billed as a restoration of free speech. He
was to abolish all those absolutely _dastardly_ platform policies limiting free
speech (queue my heavy eye roll) and return the right to say whatever you want,
however you want and no one was going to be able to take down your posts: a free
speech absolutist's utopia. But this subtly alters a user's choice. Absolutism
in this sense means no curation based on platform. I would essentially be forced
to scroll past hate speech and users I like: I couldn't freely choose. This says
nothing of a company's right to choose what material they host, they would be
handcuffed as well.

Outline:

- Layout of various paradoxes, explain them
- Current manifestations: NIMBYism (reference Yoni Appelbaum’s _Stuck: How the
  Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity_), in
  groups and out groups (willholt's law).
- hollow arguments with "controlling speech", or "abortion": preservation of
  freedom/preventing the paradox is the point
- building systems to limit
