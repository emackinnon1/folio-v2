Freedom hides a snake in the grass.

Like Jörmungandr of Norse mythology, freedom can eat itself. Subtly coiled
within the concept is a contradiction: unchecked freedom can include the freedom
to limit the freedom of others. When absolutism is taken to its limit, even our
best ideas turn in on themselves. A society that tolerates everything cannot
stand. A democracy that lets the majority rule unchecked can vote itself into
tyranny. A platform that allows all speech—no matter how hateful or false—can
become unusable for everyone else.

What sounds like a philosophical riddle from a university classroom is a daily
reality. And once you start looking, these paradoxes aren’t just lurking in the
grass—they’re shaping the way we live, vote, argue, and scroll.

# Paradoxes

### The Freedom Paradox

Freedom sounds like a no-brainer at first blush. Of _course_ we should be free
to do what we want with our lives. But friction quickly arises: my freedom to
blast music at 2 a.m. conflicts with your freedom to sleep. In a completely
unregulated market, someone could exploit others, manipulate systems, or build
monopolies, or even just... well, hire a hitman to take out the competition—and
no one could stop them.

Real freedom, paradoxically, needs boundaries.

### The Paradox of Democracy

In a true democracy, you can vote for democracy’s end. It suffers from the same
tension between absolutism and constraint.

Majorities can elect to strip rights from minorities or empower authoritarian
leadership. That sounds uncomfortably familiar in both historical and
contemporary contexts.

### The Paradox of Tolerance

Karl Popper's
[famous insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance): tolerating
the intolerable leads to a society of intolerance, as the intolerant don't
tolerate the tolerant. That tongue twister boils down to this: tolerance,
ironically, requires intolerance of certain ideas.

Otherwise, the system dies.

### The Paradox of Pluralism

Pluralism thrives when many groups with differing ideas and identities share
power and space. But it breaks down when one group uses its place at the table
to try and remove others. You see this with anti-pluralist ideologies that
attempt to enshrine one worldview—be it religious, nationalist, or otherwise—as
the only legitimate one.

Is it still pluralism if pluralism itself is undercut from within?

## Modern Manifestations

### Freedom → Twitter/X, Forced Speech Exposure and Disinformation

Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was heralded as a restoration of "free speech".
In practice, it's narrower: it reduces to a restriction of moderation, curation
and reasoned dialectics.

Musk set out to abolish all the original platform policies and return the right
to users to say whatever you want, however you want and no one was going to be
able to take down your posts: a free speech absolutist's utopia. But this subtly
alters a user's choice, as absolutism in this sense means no curation or
moderation. In other words: the freedom to choose your experience disappears. If
YouTube took this strategy (arguably they slightly do with recommendation
algorithms), they would make you watch every video whether you wanted to or not.
I would essentially be forced to scroll past hate speech, disinformation on top
of the posts I like.

This says nothing of a company's right to choose what material they host: they
are just as handcuffed if something like Section 230 were to be abolished.

Further effects are felt with an absence of guardrails against disinformation.
Obviously, we have all seen the societal damage wrought by disinformation, with
social media harboring a potential for it never seen before.

This free-wheeling, no-holds-barred speech severely limits our ability to
rationally meet the demands that our world visits upon us: how can we reasonably
make decisions in a world where people think that scientists following the
scientific method chiefly lie and get things wrong or that there is a deep state
conspiracy out to commit diabolical acts against us?

Absolutism with speech is cutting off your nose to spite your face, in the long
run. Prudent limits would go a long way.

### Democracy → Abortion Rights & Voter Suppression

Abortion laws in the U.S. are now decided by state majorities—often deeply
unrepresentative due to gerrymandering or voter suppression. In states where
most residents support abortion access, small, motivated minorities can still
pass bans to limit that most foundational of freedoms: what to do with your own
physical body. Unfortunately, the US constitution and political system is
uniquely set up to to be hamstrung by a
[tyrannical minority](http://amazon.com/Tyranny-Minority-American-Democracy-Breaking/dp/0593443071).

Voter suppression laws, meanwhile, are justified under democratic rhetoric
(“election integrity”) but reduce democracy itself by making it harder for some
marginalized groups to vote. It's not a new
[phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States),
but it certainly continues to swirl in politics, no matter if you think some of
the measures might even be good ideas _in principle_.

The democratic system is being used to reduce democratic participation. That’s
the paradox in action.

### Tolerance → Hate Speech, “Wokeness,” and Weaponized Victimhood

The tension around tolerance plays out today in the realm of public discourse.
On one side, some progressive spaces have grown increasingly prescriptive,
leading to accusations of “cancel culture” or suppression of dissent. On the
other, calls for civility or moderation are sometimes used to shield bigotry or
disinformation from accountability.

This creates a rhetorical standoff where attempts to set boundaries are painted
as oppression, while intolerance cloaks itself in the language of free
expression. The right to offend has become a shield for some honestly abhorrent,
idiotic and irresponsible behavior.

Tolerance becomes a tool used against itself.

## Subtler Renditions

### NIMBYism and Popper in the Suburbs

I recently read an excellent article in the Atlantic on the quiet loss, over the
past 50-ish years, of America's unique freedom to move and reinvent yourself.
The ramifications are quite keenly felt today, yet are often lain at the feet of
"housing shortages", "wage stagnation" and "hollowing out of the middle class".
The
[article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/03/american-geographic-social-mobility/681439/)
is worth the read, as is the book it talks about (Yoni Appelbaum’s _Stuck: How
the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity_),
but lurking in the shadows of this analysis of reduced American mobility was a
subtle rendition of the paradox of democracy.

To use the article's pithy summation:

> "A nation that had grown diverse and prosperous by allowing people to choose
> their communities would instead empower communities to choose their people."

A self-interested group of urbanists collared the open systems of mobility that
they _themselves_ benefitted from, statically preserving their own interests
over the benefits such a system visits upon all. What seems like a staple of
American life to my generation: neighborhood-level guaranteed freedoms to vote
on our own zoning, codes, development projects, etc, wasn't always so, I was
shocked to find out.

The current name for this movement is NIMBYism, an especially pernicious
political phenomenon given that most of its purveyors subscribe to ideals in
direct opposition: those of inclusion and social equality.

### The Populist Paradox

Some modern populist movements position themselves as defenders of freedom and
tradition—yet they often advocate for policies that restrict those very things
for others. They may decry “government overreach” while supporting bans,
surveillance, or ideological litmus tests. They speak of “democracy” but
question elections that don’t go their way. They celebrate “free speech” but
oppose the teaching of ideas that make them uncomfortable.

This isn’t unique to one political movement or nation, but it’s a potent example
of how paradoxes are exploited: using democratic language to justify
anti-democratic outcomes. It’s a tension between the rhetoric of liberty and the
realities of power.

## The Seduction of the Paradox

These paradoxes aren’t just academic quirks or footnotes to
democratic theory. They’re very real. They offer the comforting illusion of
coherence: that we can be totally free without consequence, or totally tolerant
without boundary, or protect democracy while hollowing out its core. That’s
where moral psychology and social contract theory come in.

Humans are tribal, moralistic(ish) animals. We’re wired to prioritize in-group
cohesion and to judge fairness through the lens of “us vs. them.” This is why
many of these paradoxes thrive in the political wild: they exploit our innate
need to feel morally justified while still protecting self-interest.

This is how systems get manipulated. When long-standing privileges are
challenged, some respond not with introspection, but with indignation—claiming
persecution in order to protect power.

- Progression to new educational theories, frameworks and lenses are
  reframed as “indoctrination.”
- Requests for religious neutrality in public life are interpreted as attacks on
  faith.
- Efforts to diversify communities and broaden the systemic benefits are seen as
  threats to self interest

These aren’t just contradictions—they’re stories people tell themselves to
preserve power while believing they’re upholding virtue.

As Wilhoit’s Law puts it:

> Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be
> in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom
> the law binds but does not protect.

Even if you don’t fully endorse Wilhoit’s framing, the point remains: the social
contract cannot function when protections and obligations are distributed
unevenly.

## The Design Dilemma: Building Systems to Limit the Paradoxes

Cool, now we have identified some philosphically paradoxical ideas, notions and
actions. Philosophers often stop here. We don’t have to. But then, what do we
do?

These paradoxes don’t mean we abandon freedom, democracy, or tolerance. But they
do mean we can’t afford to be lazy with them.

We must design systems that limit their extremes and thence, one group or
individual's ability to zero sum life's games. Constraints-as-design limit the
subjective logic of things like gerrymandering, christian/sharia law, NIMBY-ism
and the madness of bad actors and destructively riotous crowds. For Pete's sake
(whoever he is), can we _please_ implement independent bodies for voting
districts and housing/zoning? Come _on_, y'all. Clamp the damn snake's mouth
shut so it isn't even _tempted_ to eat its own tail.

That’s the trick: a strong system doesn’t give you the illusion of freedom—it
gives you boundaries and limits that protect it. Like seatbelts. Like fire
codes. Like content moderation. Like disinformation regulation. An
[invisible hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand) needs its own
invisible hand.

Thinking in terms of these limits gives you consistent ethics, it doesn't tear
them down. These aren’t infringements on liberty: they’re what make liberty
_possible_. To build society without them is to build a house of cards.

Freedom hides a snake in the grass. But if we know where it slithers, we can
build a fence. True freedom—like true democracy—isn’t a free-for-all. It’s
something we have to build, maintain, and defend from its own excesses.
