Freedom hides a snake in the grass.

Like Jörmungandr of Nordic mythology, freedom can eat itself. Subtly slithering
around within the concept it is a contradiction: unchecked freedom means I am
free to limit the freedom of others. When absolutism is taken to its limit, even
our best ideas turn in on themselves. A society that tolerates everything cannot
stand. A democracy that lets the majority rule unchecked can vote itself into
tyranny. A platform that allows all speech, no matter how hateful or false,
becomes unusable for everyone else.

What sounds like an absurd philosophical riddle from a university classroom is a
daily reality. And once you start looking, these paradoxes aren’t just lurking
in the grass—they’re shaping the way we live, vote, argue, and scroll.

# Paradoxes

### The Freedom Paradox

Freedom sounds like a no-brainer at first blush. Obviously, we all should be
free to do what we want with our lives. Just as obviously, we can can see how we
would quickly run into zero-sum scenarios: my freedom to blast music at 2am
conflicts with your freedom to sleep. In a truly unregulated market, you could
hire a hitman to eliminate the competition—and no one could stop you. You could
exploit others, manipulate markets, and form monopolies.

Real freedom, paradoxically, needs boundaries.

### The Paradox of Democracy

In a true democracy, you can vote for democracy's death. It suffers from the
same enigma of absolutism and limits.

Majorities can elect to strip rights from minorities or elect authoritarian
leaders. Huh, that sounds familiar... but am I talking about America or the
Weimar Republic? Crazy you can even compare the two, right?

### The Paradox of Tolerance

Karl Popper's
[famous insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance): society
tolerating the intolerable leads to a society of intolerance, as the intolerant
don't tolerate the tolerant. That tongue twister boils down to this: tolerance,
ironically, requires intolerance of certain ideas.

Otherwise, the system dies.

### The Paradox of Pluralism

Pluralism exists when many factions, corners of society, and stratified groups
coexist and benefit from a seat at the table. The paradox arises when one of
those groups thinks that they should sit at the table over others. You see this
with anti-pluralist ideologies like fascism, religious movements attempting to
integrate with sacred texts into statehood and law, or extreme ethnonationalist
movements.

Is it pluralism to allow pluralism to be dissassembled?

## Modern Manifestations

### Freedom → Twitter/X and Forced Speech Exposure with a Sprinkling of Disinformation

Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was heralded as a restoration of "free speech".
In practice, it's narrower: it reduces to a restriction of moderation, curation
and reasoned dialectics.

Musk set out to abolish all those absolutely _dastardly_ platform policies
limiting free speech (if only you could see my heavy eye roll) and return the
right to say whatever you want, however you want and no one was going to be able
to take down your posts: a free speech absolutist's utopia. But this subtly
alters a user's choice, as absolutism in this sense means no curation or
moderation. In other words: the freedom to curate experience disappears. I would
essentially be forced to scroll past hate speech, disinformation on top of the
posts I like.

This says nothing of a company's right to choose what material they host: they
are just as handcuffed if something like section 230 were to be abolished.

Further, an absence of guardrails against platformed information dissemination
has its own effects. Obviously, we have all seen the societal damage wrought by
disinformation, with social media harboring a potential for it never seen
before. Measles and polio are back, for christ's sake. A woman who thinks jews
are running things with their weather control and space lasers was elected into
congress, for cryin' out loud. A sitting president knowingly tried to steal a
goddamn election, and then convinced his voters that it was the _the other guy_
who stole it.

This free-wheeling, no-holds-barred speech severly limits our ability to
rationally meet the demands that our world visits upon us: how can we reasonably
make decisions in a world where people think that scientists following the
scientific method chiefly lie or get things wrong, that all conservatives are
racist ethnonationalists, all liberals are radical Marxist communists, and a guy
who bankrupted many of his businesses, has few if any ethical principles or
characteristics, is about as erratic as a rabbit on meth and has a _demonstrably
terrible_ track record on the national and international stage is going to be a
good leader of the most powerful nation on earth? Pretty insane, right?

Limits are very arguably prudent.

### Democracy → Abortion Rights & Voter Suppression

Abortion laws in the U.S. are now decided by state majorities—often deeply
unrepresentative due to gerrymandering or voter suppression. In states where
most residents support abortion access, small, motivated majorities can still
pass bans to limit that most foundational of freedoms: what to do with your own
physical body. Unfortunately, the US constitution and political system is
uniquely set up to to be hamstrung by a
[tyrannical minority](http://amazon.com/Tyranny-Minority-American-Democracy-Breaking/dp/0593443071).

Voter suppression laws, meanwhile, are justified under democratic rhetoric
(“election integrity”) but reduce democracy itself by making it harder for
marginalized groups to vote as has been documented in numerous
[instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States),
some current, no matter if you think some of these measures might even be good
ideas _in principle_.

The democratic system is being used to reduce democratic participation. That’s
the paradox in action.

### Tolerance → Hate Speech, “Wokeness,” and Weaponized Victimhood

I will preface this section by saying: the gripes I have with this topic aren't
limited to one party or the other. Certainly, conversations and progress get
bogged down from this angle by requirements from the left to walk on egg shells
and speak using the menu of acceptable lexicon.

Even so, the right to offend has become a shield for idiocy and in some cases,
hate. In the name of tolerance, platforms and public spaces allow people to
punch down—targeting the very people those spaces were meant to include.
Simultaneously, any resistance—calls for boundaries, or content moderation—is
painted as “cancel culture.” This is strategic: weaponizing victimhood to
silence criticism.

Tolerating intolerance gives intolerance the upper hand. Here it is in action.

## Subtler Renditions

### NIMBYism and Popper in the Suburbs

I recently read an excellent article in the Atlantic on the quiet loss, over the
past 50-ish years, of America's unique freedom to move and reinvent yourself.
The ramifications are quite keenly felt today, yet they are often lain at the
feet of "housing shortages", "wage stagnation" and "hollowing out of the middle
class". The
[article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/03/american-geographic-social-mobility/681439/)
is worth the read, as is the book it talks about (Yoni Appelbaum’s _Stuck: How
the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity_),
but lurking in the shadows of this analysis of reduced American mobility was a
subtle rendition of the paradox of democracy.

To use the article's pithy summation:

> "A nation that had grown diverse and prosperous by allowing people to choose
> their communities would instead empower communities to choose their people."

A self-interested group of urbanists collared the open systems of mobility that
they _themselves_ benefitted from, statically preserving their own interests
over the benefits such a system visits upon all. What seems like a staple of
American life to my generation: neighborhood-level guaranteed freedoms to vote
on our own zoning, codes, development projects, etc, wasn't always so, I was
shocked to find out.

The current name for this movement is NIMBYism, an especially pernicious
political phenomenon given that most its purveyors subscribe to ideals in direct
opposition: those of inclusion and social equality. The _oh-so-welcoming_ left
likes their moral high ground, except if that ground happens to be in their own
zip code. Then they fall into the trap of subjective logic.

### The Paradox That Wears a Red Hat

If NIMBYism is a quiet paradox—democracy used to block access, dressed in local
ordinances—then MAGA is its loud, ignorant, populist cousin. It shouts about
freedom, liberty, and the Constitution, while simultaneously advocating for
authoritarianism, censorship, and ethnic or cultural homogeneity.

The MAGA movement presents itself as a grassroots, pro-freedom revolution. But
beneath the surface, its ideological core reveals a slew of contradictions:

- Freedom of speech? Yes—for them. Liz Cheney can tell you, but question their
  rigid beliefs, say, like speaking out against the party leader's (lack) of
  principles, immigrants bringing high levels of crime (hint:
  [they don't](https://freakonomics.com/podcast-tag/the-true-story-of-americas-supremely-messed-up-immigration-system/))
  or teach history and ideas that make them uncomfortable? That’s
  “indoctrination.”
- Government tyranny? Terrifying—unless the home team is the tyrant. The same
  people crying about mask mandates cheer on state bans of books and drag shows.
- Democracy? Crucial—until the results don’t go their way. Then it’s rigged,
  corrupt, and possibly deserving of a violent overthrow or fulfilment of some
  quasi-religious manifest destiny of the "true" winner through
  [_*STEALING*_ an election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election),
  at least according to
  [the wife of one of our very](https://www.npr.org/2022/03/25/1088720571/ginni-thomas-tex-messages-mark-meadows-2020-election)
  own SCOTUS justices.

This is the paradox of democracy and pluralism in full bloom: a group uses
democratic power to dismantle democratic norms. It demands inclusion in a
pluralistic society while rejecting the legitimacy of other worldviews,
lifestyles, or ethnic groups.

The movement also weaponizes nostalgia—a yearning for a fictional past where a
narrow version of “America” was supposedly better. But the great irony is that
the very freedom and diversity that made America great are now cast as threats
to be eradicated. The system that gave rise to MAGA is the one it seeks to
destroy.

MAGA doesn’t just live inside a paradox—it thrives on it. That’s what makes it
rhetorically powerful and politically dangerous. And stupid, lest I forget.

## The Seduction of the Paradox

These paradoxes aren’t just academic quirks or footnotes to democratic theory.
They’re seductive. They offer the comforting illusion of coherence: that we can
be totally free without consequence, or totally tolerant without boundary, or
protect democracy while hollowing out its core. That’s where moral psychology
and social contract theory come in.

Humans are tribal, moralistic(ish) animals. We’re wired to prioritize in-group
cohesion and to judge fairness through the lens of “us vs. them.” This is why
many of these paradoxes thrive in the political wild: they exploit our innate
need to feel morally justified while still protecting self-interest.

[Willholt’s Law](https://curmudgucation.blogspot.com/2022/07/wilhoits-law-and-education.html)
is appropriate to invoke:

> There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside
> out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect. The law cannot protect
> anyone unless it binds everyone, and cannot bind anyone unless it protects
> everyone.

Every political movement is ultimately a group of people who think they are
being oppressed when they are no longer allowed to oppress others.

It’s a brutal distillation of the paradox of tolerance—and it’s also a glimpse
into the psychological defense mechanisms at play. When long-standing privileges
are challenged (white hegemony, patriarchy, Christian normativity, wealth
hoarding), the reaction is often moral outrage masquerading as victimhood.

Think about it: • Anti-gay activists frame themselves as victims of “wokeness”
because they can’t figuratively tar and feather "those gays" in peace anymore. •
Conservative white Christians claim religious oppression when they’re asked not
to dominate public life or school curricula. • Landowners in wealthy suburbs cry
“freedom” while fighting affordable housing laws that would slightly alter their
pristine zoning maps.

These aren’t just contradictions—they’re stories people tell themselves to
preserve power while believing they’re upholding virtue.

The social contract relies on a balance between individual liberty and
collective responsibility. But paradoxes—especially in the age of social
media—let people cherry-pick one side of the contract and scream betrayal when
the other side knocks on their door.

## The Design Dilemma: Building Systems to Limit the Paradoxes

Cool, now we have identified some philosphically paradoxical ideas, notions and
actions. Philosophers stop here. We don’t have to. But then, what do we do?

These paradoxes don’t mean we abandon freedom, democracy, or tolerance. But they
do mean we can’t afford to be lazy with them.

We must design systems that limit their extremes and thence, one group or
individual's ability to coopt the rules to their own individual needs.
Constraints-as-design limit the subjective logic of things like gerrymandering,
christian/sharia law, NIMBY-ism and the madness of bad actors and destructively
riotous crowds.

That’s the trick: a strong system doesn’t give you the illusion of freedom—it
gives you boundaries that protect it. Like seatbelts. Like fire codes. Like
content moderation. Like disinformation regulation. An
[invisible hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand) needs its own
invisible hand.

Thinking in terms of these limits gives you consistent ethics, it doesn't tear
them down. These aren’t infringements on liberty: they’re what make liberty
_possible_. To build society without them is to build a house of cards.

Freedom hides a snake in the grass. But if we know where it slithers, we can
avoid the bite. True freedom—like true democracy—isn’t a free-for-all. It’s
something we have to build, maintain, and defend from its own excesses.
