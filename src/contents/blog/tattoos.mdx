## Tattoos

Something that has gradually revealed itself to me over time is: you can learn _literally anything_ (as long as it's legal, that is).

Over the years, I have learned how to make a knifeblade from an old rasp, I learned how to make coin rings from loose change (as in,
old loose change; older coins had the coolest craftmanship), I tried my hand at scrimshaw. More recently, I have learned enough electrical engineering and about embedded software to
to make a [neat thing or two with microcontrollers](https://emackinnon.io/projects). I even had to learn most of everything I know about
coding while on the job, and that will continue as long as I am in this software industry.

The point is: after a while, unknowns change to knowns; frontiers become familiar. Things just _settle_ into place and the hard-to-grasp
becomes grasped-without-thought and second nature.

Tattooing began as something I wanted to do, but didn't know how. I also had healthy amount of fear about trying on myself.

For the first couple of them, I drew them but had someone else do them on me. Then, I discovered the stick and poke technique and went to town.
It's quite easy to get the right supplies and try it yourself (but I recommend reading up on proper cleaning and )

Then I graduated to a machine once I get tired of the long hours a single line of a stick and poke tattoo requires.
