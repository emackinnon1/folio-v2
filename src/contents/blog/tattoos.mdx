Over the years, I have learned how to make a knifeblade from an old rasp, I learned how to make coin rings from loose change (as in,
old loose change; older coins had the coolest craftmanship), I have learned enough electrical engineering and about embedded systems to
to make a [neat thing or two with microcontrollers](https://emackinnon.io/projects). Hell, I even had to learn coding on my own,
for the most part. I taught myself frontend, got thrown onto a backend team and had to figure out how to tread water. Ever since then,

Then I graduated to a machine once I get tired of the long hours a single line of a stick and poke tattoo requires.
