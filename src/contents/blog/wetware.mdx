> "The cell moves in an informed if not intelligent way."

In _Wetware_, Dennis Bray walks fine lines of definitial scale. The book is a deep dive into computation biology, sensory signals and organisms' reactions. By his own admission,
flits from scope to scope with words like words like "attention", "memory" and "knowledge", whittling at their meanings until they fit into cell behavior (and they do,
he says). The general thrust of his ideas and arguments are cells and their proteins have are siblings to the digital and analog signals in modern computers, with many
similarities to complex neural networks and computers. Yet, for now at least, silicon-rendered networks on a TPU are to their biological counterparts as my 3 year old nephew's Playdoh people
are to Michaelangelo's David.

## Simple rules

One of the passages in the book illumines the experiments of William Grey Walter. Walter set out to prove that simple logical interactions and connections could result in
rich behaviors, so he built simple robotic tortoises that "behaved" as if they were searching for food, self aware, and had memory and conditionable reflexes. The tortoises
were phototaxis, meaning they exhibited movement towards light under certain conditions. In the absence of light, they would explore the area until light was found via a motor
with a battery attached to the wheels, a simple photorecepter mounted in the head, and bump sensors on the outer shell which kicked off an "object avoidance" movement
pattern. The circuits that controlled the behavior is worth looking up, but in short, signals from different sensors were amplified or reduced by vacuum tubes and this affected
the motor and steering systems on the tortoise.

Walter built an enclosure with a kennel with a 20 Watt light inside of it. When the tortoises had full batteries, they were attracted to the kennel from afar through
their light sensor, however upon nearing the light a "repellent" response was induced because light sources over a certain intensity resulted in the motor and steering
circuits activating with double the force. However, when the batteries were low, the sensitivity to light decreased and the tortoise would be attracted to the kennel
light and now enter the kennel (before, the light would engender the repellent response) where a battery charger was located, subsequently recharging and kicking off
the whole process again.

These tortoises displayed simple, single cell organisms behavior to a degree, but even single cell organisms seem to have rudimentary abilities to "learn by experience"
patterns. Grey Walter set out to create a new version that could do the same.

His next iteration ported a sensor that could detect whistles and mixed that signal with the signals from the bump sensor and the light sensor. This new circuit allowed the
tortoise to be "trained" to come to the whistle as if it were a light. The humble, simple circuit of Walter's tortoises seemed to serve as the platform for rudimentary
Pavlovian learning.

## Facades of the unicellular world

Some of the most complex behavior in the unicellular realm comes from _Stentor roselii_. _Stentor_ is a trumpet-shaped organism that attaches itself to various surfaces
via a mucus-covered foot. At rest, its mouth is open and the fine cilia inside beat the water to create a current that pulls in particles in the water. The animal then
determines whether the particles are edible and ejects indegistable particles. When water is squirted into the open mouth, the animal contracts into a ball. A second
squirt of water is ignored by the animal. This "surprise" response was achievable through a host of stimuli, such as jarring the container the animal was in. This, like
the tortoises, seemed to point to a rudimentary form of "memory" and "learning".

When irritants or injurious particles are squirted into the mouth, _Stentor_ will bend to one side (always in the same direction) and move its mouth out of the path of
the inedible particles. This will be repeated a few times before until a more drastic action is taken: the cilia reverse direction and eject everything in the "mouth" and
"stomach" (a pouch in the middle of its "body"). This will also be repeated a few times in rapid succession. If the particles are still encountered, the organism will retract
into a ball (the same response to a surprise stream of water). This will _also_ be repeated a few times, with the animal cautiously extending and starting to beat its cilia
to ingest particles again.

The _Stentor_ will continue like this for a little bit, but it is obvious that under the continued circumstances of irritant or injurious particle ingestion, it will take longer
to extend its body from its retracted phase each time. The experience as "changed" the _Stentor_ and it will try a new strategy if this negative stimuli does not cease.
Eventually, the _Stentor_ will start to retract and extend repeatedly and violently, breaking the hold that the mucus around its foot has on whatever surface it has
attached itself to. It then uses its mouth for locomotion and explores nearby surfaces for a time and after 10 or 20 minutes, it performs a complex series of actions to
reform its mucus tube, fit inside of it, and anchor its pseudopodia to the bottom of the inside of the tube. Afterward, it resumes its normal pose: sampling the water and
beating its cilia to ingest particles in the event they are edible.

All of this is performed by a tiny fluid-filled sac less than a millimeter in length.

In the same way that Walter's second iteration of tortoises combined logical operations (`whistle present -> light attraction behavior` or `battery low and light present -> 
strength of attraction to light increases`), allosteric proteins are the platform for cellular computations and logic. Hemoglobin is as good a stepping off point as any: as oxygen
binds to different sites on a hemoglobin molecule, the neighboring atoms shift slightly to accomodate the new oxygen passenger. This subtly changes the hemoglobin structure
and other amino acids that make it up are slightly different, meaning their downstream behavior is altered ever so slightly. With a handful of bind sites, this can change a protein's
behavior drastically through different combinations of binding.

Allosteric enzyme switches are proteins that change shape when a molecule or atom binds to it, like with our hemoglobin example. As molecule _A_ snaps into place and binds to
a site on enzyme _X_ specially suited for it. _X_ transforms into a slightly different enzyme with a minutely different structure. It now supports the binding of molecule _B_,
and when _B_ binds, _X_ changes shape ever so slightly again. In this new structure any _A_ molecules bind and immediately break off, one that no longer supports binding by _A_. Inhibition or disinhibition can be achieved, dictating the logical:

```
If (A)
```

This is the jumping off point to the behavior that Walter's tortoises showed.

The mechanics of cell locomotion, ingestion and digestion, reactions to environment and other behaviors are detailed in Bray's book. At that resolution, physics and chemistry
are one in the same (they arguably are at higher orders of resolution, too). The questions then begged are: at what level do "attention", "memory" or other higher order
conscious processes resolve? Is there a clear boundary along the way? What starting point exists; no attention, or some attention?

Most microorganisms display what in higher order animals is termed "attention". Amoebas actively seek new nutrient-rich environments and "taste" what is in front of them
to gauge the best direction to persue food. While engaged in this search, other normally immediate response-inducing stimuli like temperature or chemical signals are ignored
(attention probably has its contraints at this level of complexity, as it is likely impossible for a cell to react to two distinct stimuli at once). Pick another trait or
conscious behavior, they all have a scaling problem. Attention has its roots in consciousness, because we first discovered the phenomenon in ourselves and other
seemingly-conscious animals but it oozes down into the lower depths of the animal kingdom, waning in definitional complexity, yet seemingly still present in shallower forms.

We ponder these questions with the luxury of the 21st century. Science is far from completely understanding the entire subject, but there is at least agreement on cells not displaying
consciousness and "attention" in the same way that a person might. We understand enough about cellular processes to know what logical processes are derived
from interactions of proteins. Allosteric properties of proteins were
Despite lacking necessary substrates of nerve cells, neurotransmitters, and brains that process
incoming environmental signals, build memories, complex thought and morph responses and behaviors, microorganisms, through the mediums of viscous chemical soups,
molecular structures made of allosteric proteins, the cell has networks of communication and logical meaning.
