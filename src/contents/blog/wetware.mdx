In _Wetware_, Dennis Bray walks fine lines of definitional scale. The book is a deep dive into computation biology, sensory signals and organisms' reactions. By his own admission,
flits from scope to scope with words like words like "attention", "memory" and "knowledge", whittling at their meanings until they fit into cell behavior (and they do,
he says). The general thrust of his ideas and arguments are cells and their proteins are siblings to the digital and analog circuits and signals, with many
similarities to complex neural networks and computers. Yet, for now at least, silicon-rendered networks on a TPU are to their biological counterparts as my 3 year old nephew's Playdoh people
are to Michaelangelo's David.

## Complex obscurity for simple rules

One of the passages in the book illumines the experiments of William Grey Walter. Walter set out to prove that simple logical interactions and connections could result in
rich behaviors, so he built simple robotic tortoises that "behaved" as if they were searching for food, self aware, and had memory and conditionable reflexes. The tortoises
were phototaxis, meaning they exhibited movement towards light under certain conditions. In the absence of light, they would explore the area until light was found via a motor
with a battery attached to the wheels, a simple photorecepter mounted in the head, and bump sensors on the outer shell which kicked off an "object avoidance" movement
pattern. The circuits that controlled the behavior is worth looking up, but in short, signals from different sensors were amplified or reduced by vacuum tubes and this affected
the motor and steering systems on the tortoise.

Walter built an enclosure with a kennel with a 20 Watt light inside of it. When the tortoises had full batteries, they were attracted to the kennel from afar through
their light sensor, however upon nearing the light a "repellent" response was induced because light sources over a certain intensity resulted in the motor and steering
circuits activating with double the force. However, when the batteries were low, the sensitivity to light decreased and the tortoise would be attracted to the kennel
light and now enter the kennel (before, the light would engender the repellent response) where a battery charger was located, subsequently recharging and kicking off
the whole process again.

These behaviors arose mixed signals and feedback in certain circuits and could be boiled down into logical statements. If we take the behavior of the tortoise being
attracted to light when the batteries were low, it can be represented by (with _BL_ meaning the state of low battery, _LP_ meaning there is a light source present and
_FL_ standing for "find light", or the the behavior of being attracted to the light):

```
If BL and LP, then FL
```

With simple logical rules, these tortoises displayed behavior, to a degree, that single cell organisms (or, arguably, more complex animals) might display, but even
single cell organisms seem to have rudimentary abilities to associatively learn or "learn by experience". Grey Walter set out to create a new version that could do
the same. His next iteration ported a sensor's signal that could detect whistles and mixed that signal with the signals from the bump sensor and the light sensor. This new
circuit allowed the tortoise to be "trained" to come to the whistle as if it were a light. The humble, plain circuit of Walter's tortoises seemed to serve as the
platform for rudimentary Pavlovian learning, the famous pairing of an unrelated stimulus to a behavior. What the mixing of the mixing of signals allowed for is a basic
logical _or_ statement (with _W_ representing the whistle signal, _L_ representing the presence of a light signal and _B_ representing the subsquent behavior of
heading toward the stimulus):

```
If W or L, then B
```

These simple logical statements are the basis for many aspects of programming and, in Bray's argument, biological phenomena.

## Facades of intelligence

Some of the most complex behavior in the unicellular realm comes from _Stentor roselii_. _Stentor_ is a trumpet-shaped organism that attaches itself to various surfaces
via a mucus-covered foot. At rest, its mouth is open and the fine cilia inside beat the water to create a current that pulls in particles in the water. The animal then
determines whether the particles are edible and ejects indegistable particles. When water is squirted into the open mouth, the animal contracts into a ball. A second
squirt of water is ignored by the animal. This "surprise" response was achievable through a host of stimuli, such as jarring the container the animal was in. This, like
the tortoises, seemed to point to a rudimentary form of "memory" and associative learning.

When irritants or injurious particles are squirted into the mouth, _Stentor_ will bend to one side (always in the same direction) and move its mouth out of the path of
the inedible particles. This will be repeated a few times before until a more drastic action is taken: the cilia reverse direction and eject everything in the "mouth" and
"stomach" (a pouch in the middle of its "body"). This will also be repeated a few times in rapid succession. If the particles are still encountered, the organism will retract
into a ball (the same response to a surprise stream of water). This will _also_ be repeated a few times, with the animal cautiously extending and starting to beat its cilia
to ingest particles again.

The _Stentor_ will continue like this for a little bit, but it is obvious that under the continued circumstances of irritant or injurious particle ingestion, it will take longer
to extend its body from its retracted phase each time. The experience as "changed" the _Stentor_ and it will try a new strategy if this negative stimuli does not cease.
Eventually, the _Stentor_ will start to retract and extend repeatedly and violently, breaking the hold that the mucus around its foot has on whatever surface it has
attached itself to. It then uses its mouth for locomotion and explores nearby surfaces for a time and after 10 or 20 minutes, it performs a complex series of actions to
reform its mucus tube, fit inside of it, and anchor its pseudopodia to the bottom of the inside of the tube. Afterward, it resumes its normal pose: sampling the water and
beating its cilia to ingest particles in the event they are edible.

All of this is performed by a tiny fluid-filled sac less than a millimeter in length. These stimuli and behaviors are bound, through physical and chemical interactions, in logically
renderings similar to the tortoises of William Grey Walter.

## Chemical logical operators

In the same way that Walter's second iteration of tortoises combined logical operations (`if whistle present, then light attraction behavior` or `battery low and light present, then 
strength of attraction to light increases`), allostery is the platform for cellular computations and logic. Hemoglobin is as good a stepping off point as any: as oxygen
binds to different sites on a hemoglobin molecule, the neighboring atoms shift slightly to accomodate the new oxygen passenger. This subtly changes the hemoglobin structure.
Other amino acids that make it up are now slightly different, meaning _their_ downstream behavior is altered ever so slightly. With a handful of bind sites, this can change a protein's
behavior drastically through different combinations of binding.

As molecule _A_ snaps into place and binds to a site on enzyme _X_ specially suited for it, _X_ transforms into a slightly different shape with a minutely different
structure. It now supports the binding of molecule _B_, and when _B_ binds, _X_ changes shape ever so slightly again. When _B_ is allowed to bind to protein _X_, this also
changes _B_. Maybe it loses some atoms, gains some, or is altered in some other way, but now _B_, upon binding, becomes _B'_ ("B prime"). _B'_ doesn't fit well on _X_'s
binding site anymore, so it breaks off. This is an allosteric enzyme in action. Inhibition _or_ disinhibition (like our example here) can be achieved, prescribe the
logic:

```
If A and B, then B'
```

Herein lies the connection point to the logic driving Walter's tortoises' behavior. It's the connection point to many levels of abstraction of the logic in physical behavior,
in fact. Many protein interactions constitute logical _or_ statments (if bound here do this, _or_ if bound there do that) and logical _and_ statements. Have you ever
wondered how bacterial cells lie _E. coli_ know how to turn on their flagella to propel themselves in a distinct direction, namely toward a food source?

Attached to the membrane of the _E. coli_ are outward facing receptors made of proteins with inward-facing structures, also made of proteins. These outward-facing receptors detect chemicals of interest
and at a rate that depends on the external stimuli, adds phosphate to another protein (CheY, which becomse CheYp with the phosphate attached) inside the cell via the
internal-facing structures on the inside of the membrane. Once this protein is loaded with phosphate, it diffuses through the cytoplasm and lands on the internal
structures attached to the base of the flagella. Through a cascade of shape changes, influxes of ions and protein interactions, the binding of the CheYp to the internal base of the motor drives changes in connection
and shape in other parts of the motor and flagella, generating movement.

It's worth a look at an [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nZYlyFGm50&ab_channel=XVIVOScientificAnimation)
of the flagella movement or an [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYt5135_0bs&ab_channel=SmartBiology) of the protein motors to appreciate just how insanely
complex these structures are and mechanisms are. These are all, in turn, driven by their own logic.

```
If chemical of interest present, then bind to receptor and "activate" through allostery.
If receptor activated, then internal kinase and CheY are combined to make CheYp.
If CheYp present, then bind to motor.
...
...
```

These are the physical "lines of code" driving the sophisticated behavior of cells. They are just as bound to the physical as lines of real code in software are ultimately
bound to the transistors and circuits that make it up. There is another "block of code" in the receptor that performs calculus on the rate of change of environmental stimuli,
essentially performing calculus to determine if the rate of change is up or down.

The mechanics of cell locomotion, ingestion and digestion, signal sensing, reactions to environment and other behaviors are traversed in much greater detail in Bray's book.
In a cell's universe, physics and chemistry are one in the same (they arguably are at higher orders of resolution, too) and they constitute the mechanical, logical movement
and communication networks of our arms, muscles, nervous system, hormonal signals and processing, and other similar systems. When the systems described work in conjunction
with each other, fuzzy forms of concepts like "attention" and "memory" and "learning" resolve. The existence of these denote abstractions of different
aspects of the world; each of your cells has, embedded in it, a constellation of worldly chemical and physical meaning. Much like our own neurological structures
perform classifications and abstractions, Bray has pointed out that the logical processes are remarkably consistent on down to these most minute of resolutions (even
some of the proteins are consistent; actin and myosin are used in the logic of flagellar locomotion and in our own muscle cells).

Most microorganisms display what in higher order animals is termed "attention". As illustrated, _E. coli_, among other organisms, actively seek new nutrient-rich
environments and "taste" what is in front of them to gauge the best direction to persue food. While engaged in this search, they narrow their attention; other normally
immediate response-inducing stimuli like temperature or chemical signals are ignored (attention probably has its contraints at this level of complexity, as it is likely
impossible for a cell to react to two distinct stimuli at once). Attention has its roots in human consciousness; we first discovered and described the phenomenon in
ourselves and other seemingly-conscious animals. Yet, from our place in the upper echolons of conscious powers "attention" oozes down into the lower depths of the
animal kingdom, waning in definitional complexity, yet seemingly still present in shallower forms.

At some point in the gradient of complexity, we remove ourselves from hard-coded logic and build our own. We are not chained to infinite clock cycles of the same logic like
the wasp

At what level does something like "attention" resolve? Is there a clear boundary along the way? What starting point exists; no attention, or some attention? We ponder
these questions with the luxury of the 21st century. Science is far from completely understanding the entire subject, but there is at least agreement on cells not
displaying consciousness and "attention" in the same way that a person might. The wonderfully consistent thing that Bray points out in his book is that the logic of behavior and rules
at higher levels (`if optic nerve signal present, then process image and recall name from memory`),
exist deep down into the microscopic world, stemming from physical properties of proteins. We understand enough about cellular processes to know what logical processes are derived
from interactions of proteins. Allosteric properties of proteins were
Despite lacking necessary substrates of nerve cells, neurotransmitters, and brains that process
incoming environmental signals, build memories, complex thought and morph responses and behaviors, microorganisms, through the mediums of viscous chemical soups,
molecular structures made of allosteric proteins, the cell has networks of communication and logical meaning.
