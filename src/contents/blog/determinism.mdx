Douglas Hofstadter was not the first to wrestle with the notion of a self, but he certainly laid the struggles out in a poetic manner. Does an "I" exert genuine
power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics? How can a self be born of chiefly impersonal stuff and indifferent rules
that are as selfless as a stone or a puddle? Am I therefore morally culpable for anything? Or should we judge each other for our actions any more than we judge a hurricane
for carving its paths through coastal cities?

I tend to be of the opinion that there is no real platform for top-down control; us feeling like we have it is only a byproduct of our conscious "user-illusion", to use Daniel
Dennett's term. Every behavior I exhibit has its roots in physical causes and laws sweeping molecules and cells around the cluster of organized material. As far as I can
tell, there seem to be no breaks in chains of causality at any relevant levels. While we may never be able to predict future states because of difficulties related to the
nonlinear systems, that doesn't mean that those bodies don't participate in causal systems with deterministic rules; they just suffer from computational irreducibility.

The supposition with free will is that in every one of these incredibly complex, giant chains of causality in your local body, there is a state not beholden to the state
before. Essentially, there is a causeless event.

Rough outline:

- lay out position of hard determinism, chain of causality, causless causes, quantum physics and hard incompatibilism
- delineate the necessity of morality to choice
- lay out fatalism and how I avoid it
- we invoke intent and choice as the quickest way to explain behaviors and cannot

things to include:

- traditional methods struggle with computational irreducibility, meaning the system’s evolution cannot be predicted by any process more efficient than running the simulation itself
- The “I” is the nexus in our brain, one of many symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse.
- we hold to a wavering line of moral culpability: insanity or schizophrenia reduces the amount of responsibility of an affected person. this line has marched in a single
  direction, we used to put animals on trial for their moral responsibility. the mechanics that go awry are simple in the normal range for the rest of us, but no less mechanical.
