> "We human beings are macroscopic structures in a universe whose laws reside at a microscopic level."

Douglas Hofstadter was not the first to wrestle with the notion of a self, but he certainly laid the struggles out in a poetic manner. Does an "I" exert genuine
power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics? Are the natural laws irrelevant at a certain level of abstraction?
How can a self be born of chiefly impersonal stuff and indifferent rules that are as selfless as a stone or a puddle or a black hole? Am I therefore morally culpable
for anything? Or should we judge each other for our actions any more than we judge a hurricane for carving its horrific paths of destruction through coastal cities?

The idea of “free will” has emerged over the past two millennia as the canonical designation for a significant kind of control over one's actions.

I tend to have a hard time imagining a true platform for top-down control. Us feeling like we have it is only a byproduct of our conscious "user-illusion", to use Daniel
Dennett's term. Every behavior I exhibit has its roots in physical causes and laws outside of my awareness, sweeping molecules and cells around the cluster of organized material.
As far as I can tell in my layman's understanding of the universe, there seem to be no breaks in chains of causality at any relevant levels. While we may never be able
to predict future states because of difficulties related to the nonlinear systems, that doesn't mean that those bodies don't participate in causal systems with
deterministic rules; they just suffer from computational irreducibility. This view has implications on moral responsibility (how can you hold someone responsible for actions
that are in no way under their "control"), justice systems, and human development. Their meanings and assumptions are thrown in disarray under determinism, both practically
and philosophically.

This is a hard determinist position, which falls under incompatibilism (meaning free will and determinism are incompatible) and, further, holds determinism as the true state of the universe.
The view has been around since the golden age of greek philosophy, mulled over for thousands of years, bearing implications wherever you land with it. Scientific disciplines have taken up the mantle
in various fields, which have informed fuller pictures on the concepts. The other generally-encountered competing positions are worth setting out:

Hard determinism is not the only incompatibilist view. Libertarian free will posits that it is impossible for free will and determinism to both be true, according to their
account, free will is true, determinism is therefore false. Choices are executed independent of prior causes and natural laws. This preserves moral responsibility, handing the
reigns of choice to an individual, and preserves ethical frameworks centered on self-determination and autonomy. Heavy criticisms come from neuroscience and physics,
where a mountain experimental evidence favors physical processes governing behavior. Two main theories of Libertarianism exist:

**Agentic-Causal Libertarianism**: This view suggests that people are the ultimate cause of their actions, meaning they can initiate actions independently of prior causes. When
a tree falls, it does so because of the wind, the weak grip of the earth by its roots, or whatever the cause may be. When a person performs a free, _they are the cause_ of
a subsequent event. The action was not uncaused, because the agent caused it. What an adept thinker might notice is that you introduce the idea of an unmoved mover, a
foundational difficulty for the theory.

**Event-Causal Libertarianism**: Libertarians of this ilk presuppose physical indeterminism, designating it as the ingredient that allows for agents to cause indeterministic
events. Here, "indeterminism" is a stand-in for "randomness". Randomness, as a common objection runs, sets itself orthogonally to any sort of control one might have on any
controlled decision. Does chance evoke responsibility? Epicurus, an extremely prescient philosopher who came up with the idea of atoms thousands of years before they were even
observable, thought that atoms _swerved_ from otherwise determined paths, breaking causal chains. He thought that this provided enough room for humans to transcend necessity and
chance, meaning praise and blame were appropriate.

Fatalism, something I touched on in an earlier [blog post](https://emackinnon.io/blog/logic). This is the belief that all events are predetermined and
inevitable. You might think that sounds pretty darn close to determinism, but in different words. The difference between the two is that determinism sees events as results of long
causal chains, whereas fatalism says that rather than being the result of these chains, events will occur no matter what "choices" are made leading up to them. Critics note
that it is a quick off-ramp to nihilism and simplifies the complexity of causality and human agency.

One final view is compatibilism, or soft determinism, the other umbrella under which a view on this subject can exist, holds that free will and determinism _are_ compatible; one does not preclude the other. Compatibilists, who
can count Daniel Dennett, Thomas Hobbes and David Hume among their number, argue that even if determinism is true, people act freely in the sense that their actions align
with their intentions, desires and rational deliberations. There is a subtle shift of definitions here which is worth noting. Say you have the motivation (in a determinist's eyes, on rendered
through factors that is determined at various levels outside of your "control") that you'd like to stay healthy and avoid sweets. The compatibilist says, leaving prior causes to
one side for now, since this is the desire, we can define your motivations or desires as simply that. Do you act in accordance or against it? This means that a
software program running on a processor in a robot might be considered to have "will" and "motivation" and when acting in accordance with its code. Criticisms of this
school of thought tend to center on the redefinition of "free will"; determinists and libertarians alike think it side steps the actual question ("Could one choose otherwise?"),
but the practicality follows much of how society functions: We have retreated, when we deem appropriate, behind a line of deterministic absolution of guilt for crimes
committed when it is judged that someone could not choose another avenue due to biological disease (i.e. committing a crime while in the middle of a bipolar episode, or at the onset of
[Huntington's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilmer)). It acknowledges causality while maintaining accountability. The trouble is where the line actually exists: those
brain cells, mechanically, work the exact same when we have schizophrenia versus when we don't, it's just that schizophrenia has a different set of outcomes.

The reason I am even writing this post is because, after having read several compelling treatises on the matter, I still have trouble settling myself. As I said earlier, I truly do
believe that hard determinism is the case of the world. However, I am stuck in a "user illusion"; a simplified representation of reality much like a desktop user is presented
with a simplified graphical interface that allows a user to interact with what is actually an incredibly complex tool. Even the user illusion is evidence to make me doubt free will:
if all the sensations and thoughts I feel are just datum sorted into the user illusion, how and where would free will fit in?

When I navigate my world, however, I tend to color human-centered phenomena with shades of motivation and intent, with purviews like responsibility and locuses of control, which
in turn inform views on society and the justice system, treatment of disease and ethics. While I truly believe I could not have "chosen otherwise" in any circumstance in my life,
you wouldn't know that from the way I speak about my life and the events in it. Several authors on topics such as free will, consciousness and biology have employed the same
linguistic shorcuts I do, talking about the "choice" and "plan" of things like single-celled organisms (while making it clear that these are certainly figures of speech).

So, should free will even matter to me if I have this invisible straightjacket, user illusion, on? What's the point of invoking it if I don't stay consistent, especially when
I conceptualize events in my own mind? And where do my views on morals fit in if determinism calls those into question?

A recent book I read was Robert Sapolsky's _Determined: A Science of Life without Free Will_ which largely laid out, in a much clearer way and with all the weight of neuroscientific expertise
that Sapolsky has earned, my struggles. In it, Sapolsky endeavors to talk about this topic from a scientific perspective, an
approach that I find grounding when topics become too airy and abstract: what is even _possible_ in the physical world, and should we reform our concepts based on that? The book itself
is obviously worth the read (his previous book, Behave, even moreso), but a [summary of the book](https://www.psychiatrypodcast.com/psychiatry-psychotherapy-podcast/a-summary-of-determined-by-robert-sapolsky-does-free-will-existalexander-horwitz-md)
done for an interview is a great distillation.

In the book, he runs through Libetian experiements, Phineas Gage and sliding scales of free will, the neurobiology and endocrinology of intent, and a writeup of _Aplysia californica_
that won a nobel prize in physiology for Eric Kandel which is absolutely golden for explaining the physiology of responses, learning, and [memory](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/4134556).
The accessible description of the _Aplysia_ is by itself a gold nugget of insight into the physiology of complex, high level behavior, of the exact kind I talked about in
[another blog post](https://emackinnon.io/blog/wetware). Being a neuroscientist in his 60s, he has found many, many physical mechanisms of behavior and, like me, does not
understand where, in these long, complex chains (more like networks) of biological causality you'd find the space for an untethered free will. He also expresses the same frustrations
with an inability to _act_ like he knows all of this; he also has his user illusion straightjacket on, and it's snug.

He attempts to straighten out the muddy implications of morality and justice in a deterministic world, one of my long-held struggles with hard determinism.
Say you design a determined universe, with people and societies, from first principles. Could you do a better and a worse job, given you know that all things rely on
prior causes? Could you leverage the circumstances of change to biological and neurological systems, psychology, and society to form better or worse outcomes? Could you
build a system of accountability around such ideas, separating the harmful people as judged by legal and criminal standards, and moving forward into a future of better
outcomes, addressing the social and biological determinants of harm and crime, while leaving morally-derived punishments behind? Could we leave behind the idea of someone
"deserving" punishment?

I think so. I also think it scoffolds right up against other theories on morality that invoke rationality and utility. What holds us back from a world without punishment and
one centered around circumstantial change, more akin to a medical quarantine model, is one of the very systems that Sapolsky knows so intimately: the dopamine reward pathways.
It feels good to retributively punish people in the same way it feels good to accomplish a goal.

While he mostly sticks to the shallows of philosophy in the book, he does bring up one philosopher: Albert Camus and his Absurdism. Absurdism is the philosophical thesis that life, or
the world in general, is absurd. Sapolsky thinks hard determinism might even bring Absurdism to a new level: not only might life be meaningless and the universe be indifferent,
we are not even free to make our own decisions. We are not captains of our ship, our ship never had space for a captain. We are automatons, but stuck with an illusion of agency
and sensations that make us think our will is free.

Hating a person for the way they act is the same as hating a storm for thundering.

I'll probably still mull over this topic for the rest of my life, but I have to admit, there is a certain clean elegance brought to bear on morals with the scientific
approach.
