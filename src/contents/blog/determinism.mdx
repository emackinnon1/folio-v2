Douglas Hofstadter was not the first to wrestle with the notion of a self, but he certainly laid the struggles out in a poetic manner. Does an "I" exert genuine
power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics? Are the natural laws irrelevant at a certain level of abstraction?
How can a self be born of chiefly impersonal stuff and indifferent rules that are as selfless as a stone or a puddle or a black hole? Am I therefore morally culpable
for anything? Or should we judge each other for our actions any more than we judge a hurricane for carving its horrific paths of destruction through coastal cities?

The idea of “free will” has emerged over the past two millennia as the canonical designation for a significant kind of control over one's actions.

I tend to have a hard time imagining a true platform for top-down control. Us feeling like we have it is only a byproduct of our conscious "user-illusion", to use Daniel
Dennett's term. Every behavior I exhibit has its roots in physical causes and laws outside of my awareness, sweeping molecules and cells around the cluster of organized material.
As far as I can tell in my layman's understanding of the universe, there seem to be no breaks in chains of causality at any relevant levels. While we may never be able
to predict future states because of difficulties related to the nonlinear systems, that doesn't mean that those bodies don't participate in causal systems with
deterministic rules; they just suffer from computational irreducibility.

This is a hard determinist position, which falls under incompatibilism (meaning free will and determinism are incompatible) and, further, holds determinism as the true state of the universe.
The view has been around since the golden age of greek philosophy, mulled over for thousands of years, bearing implications wherever you land. Scientific disciplines have taken up the mantle
in various disciplines, which has informed fuller pictures on the concepts. The other generally-encountered competing positions are worth setting out.

Hard determinism is not the only incompatibilist view. Libertarian free will posits that it is impossible for free will and determinism to both be true, according to their
account, free will is true, determinism is therefore false. Choices are executed independent of prior causes and natural laws. Two main theories of Libertarianism exist:

**Agentic-Causal Libertarianism**: This view suggests that people are the ultimate cause of their actions, meaning they can initiate actions independently of prior causes. When
a tree falls, it does so because of the wind, the weak grip of the earth by its roots, or whatever the cause may be. When a person performs a free, _they are the cause_ of
a subsequent event. The action was not uncaused, because the agent caused it. What an adept thinker might notice is that you introduce the idea of an unmoved mover, a
foundational difficulty for the theory.

**Event-Causal Libertarianism**: Libertarians of this ilk presuppose physical indeterminism, designating it as the ingredient that allows for agents to cause indeterministic
events. Here, "indeterminism" is a stand-in for "randomness". Randomness, as a common objection runs, sets itself orthogonally to any sort of control one might have on any
controlled decision. Does chance evoke responsibility? Epicurus, an extremely prescient philosopher who came up with the idea of atoms thousands of years before they were even
observable, thought that atoms _swerved_ from otherwise determined paths, breaking causal chains. He thought that this provided enough room for humans to transcend necessity and
chance, meaning praise and blame were appropriate.

Compatibilism, the other umbrella under which a view on this subject can exist, holds that free will and determinism _are_ compatible; one does not preclude the other. Compatibilists, who
can count Daniel Dennett, Thomas Hobbes and David Hume among their number, argue that even if determinism is true, people act freely in the sense that their actions align
with their intentions, desires and rational deliberations. There is a subtle shift here which is worth noting. Say you have the motivation (in a determinist's eyes, on rendered
through factors that is determined at various levels outside of your "control") that you'd like to stay healthy and avoid sweets. The compatibilist says, leaving prior causes to
one side for now, since this is the desire, we can define your motivations or desires as simply that. Do you act in accordance or against it? This means that a complex-enough
software program running on a cpu in a robot might be considered to have "will" and "motivation" and when acting in accordance with its code, will be exemplifying free will.

every one of these incredibly complex, giant chains of causality in your local body, there is a state not beholden to the state before. Essentially, there is a causeless
event or a causeless agentic action that an individual can impel.

Rough outline:

cannot exit my user illusion, the straightjacket is imperceptable

- Determinism: Everything, including human actions, is determined by prior causes.
  Libertarianism: Humans have free will and can make choices independent of prior causes.
  Compatibilism: Free will and determinism are compatible; freedom is about acting in line with one's desires, even if those desires are determined.
  Hard Determinism: Determinism is true, and thus free will does not exist.
  Incompatibilism: Free will and determinism are incompatible; they cannot both be true.
  Fatalism: Everything is inevitable, and human actions don't change the outcome.
- lay out position of hard determinism, chain of causality, causeless causes, quantum physics and hard incompatibilism
- delineate the necessity of morality to choice
- lay out fatalism and how I avoid it
- we invoke intent and choice as the quickest way to explain behaviors and cannot

things to include:

- traditional methods struggle with computational irreducibility, meaning the system’s evolution cannot be predicted by any process more efficient than running the simulation itself
- The “I” is the nexus in our brain, one of many symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse.
- we hold to a wavering line of moral culpability: insanity or schizophrenia reduces the amount of responsibility of an affected person. this line has marched in a single
  direction, we used to put animals on trial for their moral responsibility. the mechanics that go awry are simple in the normal range for the rest of us, but no less mechanical.
