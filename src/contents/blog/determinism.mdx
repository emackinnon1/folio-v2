Douglas Hofstadter was not the first to wrestle with the notion of a self and
the role it plays, but he certainly laid the struggles out in a poetic manner.
Does an "I" exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it
helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics? Are the natural laws irrelevant
at a certain level of abstraction? How can a self be born of chiefly impersonal
stuff and indifferent rules that are as selfless as a stone or a puddle or a
black hole? Am I therefore morally culpable for anything? Or should we judge
each other for our actions any more than we judge a hurricane for carving its
horrific paths of destruction through coastal cities?

The idea of “free will” has emerged over the past two millennia as the canonical
designation for a significant kind of control over one's actions.

I tend to have a hard time imagining a true platform for top-down control. In my
view, us feeling like we have it is only a byproduct of our conscious
"[user-illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_illusion)", which deposited
a few evolutionary advantages. Every behavior I exhibit has its roots in
physical causes and laws outside of my awareness, sweeping molecules and cells
around the cluster of organized material. As far as I can tell in my layman's
understanding of the universe, there seem to be no breaks in chains of causality
at any relevant levels. While we may never be able to predict future states
because of difficulties related to nonlinear or chaotic systems, that doesn't
mean that those bodies don't participate in causal chains with deterministic
rules; they just suffer from computational irreducibility. This view has
implications on moral responsibility (how can you hold someone responsible for
actions that are in no way under their "control"?), justice systems, and human
development.

This is a **hard determinist** position, which falls under **incompatibilism**
(meaning free will and Determinism are incompatible) and, further, holds
Determinism as the true state of the universe. The view has been around since
the golden age of greek philosophy, mulled over for thousands of years, bearing
implications wherever you land with it. Scientific disciplines have taken up the
mantle in various fields, which have informed fuller pictures on the concepts. A
few other different schools exist under Determinism which have slightly
different approaches.

The other
[competing positions on free will are worth looking into](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/taxonomy.html),
and there are many.

Besides Determinism, the two other broad, and most relevant to this blog post,
positions are Libertarianism and Compatibilism.

**Libertarianism**, like Determinism, is also a broad incompatibilist position
but with the opposite take. According to their account free will is true and
Determinism is therefore false. Choices are executed independent of prior causes
and natural laws. This preserves moral responsibility, handing the reigns of
choice to an individual, and preserves ethical frameworks centered on
self-determination and autonomy. There are a few flavors of Libertarianism, like
Event-Causal and Agent-Causal, that place emphasis on different parts of the
equations cause, but they remain staunch in their belief that you could, at
various forks in the road during life, "choose otherwise". Heavy criticisms (my
own included) come from neuroscience and physics, where, as the decades have
ticked by the list of experimental evidence continues to aver physical processes
governing behavior, never really substantiating anything else or retreating from
this idea. Other attempts are to leave sufficient cause behind via
indeterminancy, which might not offer much of a better defense: randomness
doesn't provide control.

One final broad view is **Soft Determinism**, or **Compatibilism**, which holds
that free will and Determinism _are_ compatible; one does not preclude the
other. Most people, I would imagine, think along the lines of this position.
Compatibilists, who can count Daniel Dennett, Thomas Hobbes and David Hume among
their number, argue that even if Determinism is true, people act freely in the
sense that their actions align with their intentions, desires and rational
deliberations.

That is a subtle shift of definitions here which is worth noting: if you have
the motivation that you'd like to stay healthy and avoid sweets, the
compatibilist says, leaving prior causes to one side for now, since this is the
desire, we can define your will as simply that. Do you act and make choices in
accordance or against it? A software program running on a processor in a robot
might be considered to have "will" and "motivation" in this sense, as such
displaying free will when acting in accordance with its programming.

Criticisms of compatibilism tend to center on the redefinition of "free will";
determinists and libertarians alike think it side steps the actual question
("Could one choose otherwise?"), but the practicality follows much of how
society functions and tends to think. We have retreated, when we deem
appropriate, behind a wavering line of deterministic absolution of guilt for
crimes committed when it is judged that someone could not choose otherwise due
to things like manic episodes, or at the onset of
[Huntington's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gilmer). It acknowledges
causality while maintaining moral and ethical responsibility. As more comes to
light about the conditions and mechanics of neuronal networks, we will hopefully
be reevaluating this line The trouble is where the line actually exists: those
brain cells, mechanically, work the exact same when we have schizophrenia versus
when we don't, it's just that schizophrenia has a different set of outcomes that
aren't narrowed down to a set of harmful ones.

The reason I am even writing this post is because, after having run the gambit
of positions on this debate, I still have trouble settling myself and toeing the
line of my current position of Hard Determinism. Day-to-day, I probably sound
like a Compatibilist and have to admit: Compatibilism is appealing. However, I
don't like the subtle redefining of will that, in my view, avoids the answers
most seek with the overall question. As I said earlier, I truly do believe that
Hard Determinism is the case of the world. However, I am stuck in a "user
illusion"; a simplified representation of reality much like a desktop user is
presented with a simplified graphical interface that allows a user to interact
with what is actually an incredibly complex tool. Even the user illusion is
evidence to make me doubt free will: if all the sensations and thoughts I feel
are just datum sorted into the user illusion, how and where would free will fit
in?

When I navigate my world, however, I tend to color human-centered phenomena with
shades of motivation and intent, with purviews like responsibility and locuses
of control, which in turn inform views on society and the justice system,
treatment of disease and ethics. While I truly believe I could not have "chosen
otherwise" in any circumstance in my life, you wouldn't know that from the way I
speak about my life and the events in it. Several authors on topics such as free
will, consciousness and biology have employed the same linguistic shorcuts I do,
talking about the "choice" and "plan" of things like single-celled organisms
(while making it clear that these are certainly figures of speech).

So, should free will even matter to me if I have this invisible straitjacket, my
user illusion, on? What's the point of invoking it if I don't stay consistent,
especially when I conceptualize events in my own mind? And where do my views on
morals fit in if Determinism calls those into question?

> The machinery of memory and learning, according to Aplysia

A recent book I read was Robert Sapolsky's _Determined: A Science of Life
without Free Will_ which largely laid out, in a much clearer way and with all
the weight of neuroscientific expertise that Sapolsky has earned, my struggles.
In it, Sapolsky endeavors to talk about this topic from a scientific
perspective, an approach that I find grounding when topics become airy and
abstract: what is even _possible_ in the physical world, and should we reform
our concepts based on that? Everyone since Aristotle and Plato have made a meal
of it philosophically, but I have been interested in how views might nestle into
the physical sciences. The book itself is obviously worth the read (his previous
book, _Behave_, even moreso), but a few
[summaries of the book](https://www.psychiatrypodcast.com/psychiatry-psychotherapy-podcast/a-summary-of-determined-by-robert-sapolsky-does-free-will-existalexander-horwitz-md)
and his views can be found scattered across the internet.

In the book, he runs through Libetian experiements, Phineas Gage and sliding
scales of free will, the neurobiology and endocrinology of intent, and a writeup
of _Aplysia californica_, the same analysis of which won Eric Kandel a nobel
prize in physiology. This chapter is absolutely golden for explaining the
physiology and biology of responses, learning, and
[memory](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/4134556), of the exact
kind I talked about in [another blog post](https://emackinnon.io/blog/wetware).
Being a neuroscientist in his 60s, he has found many, many physical mechanisms
of behavior and, like me, does not understand where, in these long, complex
chains (more like networks) of biological causality you'd find the space for an
untethered free will. He also expresses the same frustrations with an inability
to _act_ like he knows all of this; he also has his user illusion straitjacket
is just as snugly fit as mine.

So after all this talk of physical systems and biology and neuro-mechanics,
let's back up a second to a common objection: How do you even figure out what's
"good" or "bad", "right" or "wrong" in the midst of all this? The ideas of
morally "good" and "bad" behavior seem skewed if someone's Pre-Frontal Cortex
configuration and white matter connections or their socialization and
development trajectories (ensconced in their brain) make it impossible for them
to do anything else. So then, aren't those brains and systems just doing things
the only way they _can_, simply following their own mechanics? What do biology
and physics tell you about "good" or "bad" or "better" or "worse"? What grounds
do we have to judge anything at all, identifying one behavior over the other as
desirable?

Wouldn't those notions lose meaning?

I don't think so.

Say you design a determined universe, with people and societies, from first
principles. Could you do a better and a worse job, given you know that all
things rely on prior causes? Could you leverage the circumstances of change to
biological and neurological systems, psychology, and society to form better or
worse outcomes? Could you build a system of accountability around such ideas,
separating the harmful people as judged by legal and criminal standards, and
moving forward into a future of better sequelae, addressing the social and
biological determinants of harm and crime, while ridding ourselves of the idea
of morally-righteous punishments? Could we leave behind the idea of someone
"deserving" punishment and simply have a process of addressing and rehabiliting
any detremental gene mutations and poor environments for the better?

Do you think it's possible that some configurations result in better lives for
the individual and society and world?

I think so.

What holds us back from a world without punishment and one centered around
circumstantial change, where the carrying out of justice is more akin to a
medical quarantine model, is one of the very systems that Sapolsky knows so
intimately: the dopamine reward pathways. It feels good to retributively punish
people in the same way it feels good to accomplish a goal. It's a phenomenon as
old as humans. The same systems and mechanisms show up in primates and other
animals, in fact. Gluticosteroids are reduced, dopamine and serotonin are
released, and the neurosystems that promote tribalism and selfishness are
satisfied. All of this is, unfortunately, a holdover that doesn't scale as well
with modern society. It may be that we have to intervene on these systems to
hope to have an overhaul of morality and justice that sticks. If the punishment
of crime is reclassified as a short-sighted, but very real, hedonistic
indulgence under the light of science, what good is spending money on known
inefficiencies in our judicial systems like Joe Arpaio and other hardliner's
ideas of justice, especially as we are able to intervene on genes and biology
more and more? Shouldn't we aim for lasting change, and above all, a reduction
in tribal anger and judgement based on behavioral determinants that are under no
control of ours?

So to answer my own question earlier about what's the point of all this if I
can't even always remember not to color intents and behaviors with a veneer of
"you could have chosen otherwise and you deserve retribution", it seems like
moving in a direction _away_ from the moral highgrounds and retributive
punishment might not only be the best direction for us as a whole, but me
individually. It certainly bakes a certain logic in that helps temper my own
dispositions during interactions with others (especially having been the one to
exhibit harmful behavior at different points in life, as we all have).

While he doesn't wade very deep and mostly sticks to the shallows of philosophy
in the book, he does bring up one philosopher: Albert Camus and Absurdism.
Absurdism is the philosophical thesis that life, or the world in general, is
absurd. Sapolsky thinks Hard Determinism might even bring Absurdism to a new
level: not only might life be meaningless and the universe be indifferent, we
are not even free to make our own decisions. We are not captains of our ship,
our ship never even had a helm, let alone a captain. We are automatons, but
stuck with an illusion of agency and sensations that make us think our will is
applied to the universe instead of the universe applying to us.

Hating a person for the way they act is the same as hating a storm for
thundering.

I'll probably still mull over this topic for the rest of my life, but I have to
admit, there is a certain clean elegance brought to bear on morals with the
scientific approach.
