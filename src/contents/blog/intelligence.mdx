The accelerating pace of neuroscience in the last few decades has yielded
extraordinary insights into the nature of human intelligence. What was once the
exclusive domain of philosophical conjecture—questions about the source,
stability, and limits of human cognition—has now become increasingly susceptible
to empirical inquiry. This shift, fueled by advances in neuroimaging,
psychometrics, and genetics, has overturned many of our long-held intuitions
about the mind and its potential. And yet, our discourse—both scientific and
public—has failed to fully integrate these findings, leaving us in a state of
moral and political dissonance.

Recently, I read a book that dove deep into the state of the field: _The
Neuroscience of Intelligence_ (part of the Cambridge series of neuroscience of
psychology) by Richard Haier. Several of my moral and philosphical
presuppositions—those of intelligence, social outcomes, and the malleability of
individual potential-were exposed. Unsurprisingly, when I think about it, the
book augmented [some other views](https://emackinnon.io/blog/determinism) I
have. Reexamination of assumptions is rarely a waste of time, however.

It is no small thing to realize that much of what we consider solvable through
intervention may, in fact, be underwritten by a genetic architecture far more
resistant to change than we had hoped. The implications are profound. If the
boundaries of intelligence are more constrained than commonly thought, it may be
that we need to rescope our ambitions for public policy and social programs. The
prevailing assumption has been that, with the right combination of investments
in education and social opportunity we can significantly uplift cognitive
outcomes across populations. I will flirt a bit with politics, but hopefully my
views are rational enough to be acceptable and worth thinking about, even if you
disagree on various levels.

## PFIT (Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory)

The core of Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory proposes that there are a number
of regions in the brain that underlie intelligent behavior and there is a clear,
structured flow, form and function. Evidence for PFIT is multidimensional,
resting on imaging research, lesion studies, and psychometrics. Sensory data
percolates through the parietal lobe and is elaborated on by the frontal lobe,
with interactions between the two generating evaluations and calculations and
the anterior cingulate cortex playing a role in inhibiting or promoting
responses. There is a general consensus that the PFIT is seen as the "best
available answer" to the question of "where" in the brain intelligence resides,
with a hint of "how" intelligence works.

Haier's overview teases out a few key concepts:

#### Structure and Function

Intelligence is 100% biological, physical phenomenon. Variance in intelligence
is strongly linked to brain structures like gray matter, cortical thickness,
efficiency, and white matter ingegrity. Intelligence can be measured relatively
well through psychometrics and chronometrics, and is individually stable. While
limits seem stable, under nuanced circumstances like learning new skills, it may
be moderately improved in some areas. Less activity (in some regions and under
some circumstances) correlates to higher IQs in many cases (with some nuance),
suggesting that efficient networks play a part in intelligence. All of these
metrics are very predictive of certain outcomes like school achievements and
socioeconomic status (however, there is much to dig into and many confounds to
address with that correlation).

#### Genes' Major Role

Data overwhelmingly points to genes and gene expression, not environment,
playing the major role in variance in intelligence. While the
genes-to-intelligence relationship remains controversial politically, it is not
so scientifically. We will benefit from reddressing valid concerns given past
historical misuses, terrible ethics of intelligence research and treatment of
disadvantaged research subjects. The most compelling evidence for genes'
dominant role is studies on identical twins raised apart and children raised in
different homes from their parents. This framework of children are considered a
gold standard for gene and gene expression studies. The correlation coefficient
of intelligence is about 77%, having been replicated time and time again with
increasingly large population studies. Despite the ongoing failure identify even
a single gene as one that is _definitively_ responsible for differences in
intelligence, Haier, via the experimental data relays that intelligence is _A)_
suspected by many to be pleiotropic and _B)_ broadly accepted as polygenic:
meaning _A)_ one intelligence gene could affect many dissimilar traits and _B)_
it is accepted that many genes contribute in a lot of small ways to overall
intelligence. Epigenetic variances remain a wrinkle to unravel, but even so, it
is clear that environment is operating on the biological material it has at
hand.

#### Environment's Relevance

The same studies that point to genes' influence also point to environment
playing a role, but the role is nuanced. Nutrition, stable learning
environments, and socioeconomic status all influence cognitive development.
Early on, differences in environment account for a high percentage (around 75%
at age 5!) of differences of intelligence, but this drops to less 20 percent by
age 18. Environment platforms development, but its reach is weaker than once
believed. Early interventions, such as heavy investment in childhood programs,
with the goal of raising latent ability (with the most obvious outcome being
notably higher test scores), have been insipid and limited. With more
understanding of the biological substrate of intelligence, this could change.

#### Enhancement is Limited

So far, putative intelligence improvement through brain-training and enhancement
abilities are limited, despite a heavy industry built around this idea. While it
was hoped that we might find low cost, low effort interventions like memory
training or listening to Mozart, many experimental results have been at best,
overstated and underwhelming, and at worst, offered modest but temporary
improvements. The real hope remains intervention through biology and some
extremely interesting pathways are in development. Check out
[DREADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand),
classes of synthetic, engineered neuronal receptors that activated through
synthetic transmitters or
[optogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics) to get tantalizing
glimpses of a future where brain function can be modified with precision. But
for now, the genetic architecture of intelligence remains remarkably stubborn.

#### Neuroscience Could and Should Inform Policy

Intelligence and socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined at the
neurological level. Intelligence has a heritable component, but gene expression
is influenced by environmental factors which makes it hard to tell the causal
direction phenotypical traits. Variance in intelligence centers around many of
the same neurological structures the socioeconomic status (SES) tends to affect.
For example: Lower SES is often associated with chronic stress (e.g., financial
instability, food insecurity, exposure to violence). Chronic stress leads to
dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased
cortisol levels, which negatively impact brain structures like the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex. These same brain regions are crucial for cognitive
function and intelligence, meaning that SES-related stress can influence
cognitive abilities, blurring things quite profoundly. Haier argues that
understanding the neuroscience of intelligence will lead to better interventions
on early childhood education leading to maximized potentials.

## Genetics and the Limits of Malleability

I had a few of my views absolutely _shattered_ by Haier's summation of the state
of research. Familiar to me was that genes and their expression are the supreme
governors of our individual conditions, but what was _unfamiliar_ to me was how
few broad environmental levers we have at our disposal, besides the basics of
nutrition, stress and poverty, to _influence_ those expressions.

To be honest, all of this probably should not have been too much of a surprise
given findings like the
[ceiling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7243589/#:~:text=Abstract,fixed%20limit%20to%20longevity%20too)
we seem to have hit with longevity. It should really come as no surprise if you
have read one of my all time favorite books in the world ever [Behave]() by
Robert Sapolsky. Physical systems have rules and boundaries, and while there is
wiggle room, eventually you have to intervene on the system itself to make
changes. There is a difference between _realizing potential_ and _enhancing
potential_.

In case it is still a bit fuzzy (because, let's be honest, heritability can be
freakin' confusin'), we should hash out the finer points of the age-old "genes
vs environment" debate.

Imagine you are in a Lego building competition. You are going to build a
life-sized replica of the Sistine Chapel, ceiling and all, and will be scored on
accuracy. The accuracy score of the replica can represent intelligence scores,
the individual Legos blocks in the set you are given represent genes, and your
creativity represents the environmental forces brought to bear on the Legos. As
is plain to see, accuracy scores boil down to some combination of the set of
legos bricks (genes) you have and your creative ability (environment). If you
_really_ want to fill out the analogy, the way your creativity influences how
you use the bricks themselves (maybe you modify them by hand or use them in
extremely unconventional ways), might be something like epigenetics, but we can
ignore that part for now.

You might see how, even if you aren't entirely sure that it's a 50/50 split
between Legos and creativity that determines accuracy score, you could form some
questions to figure it out:

> How well would an unimaginative IRS tax accountant do with all the best Lego
> pieces?
>
> How accurate could Picasso be with a bunch of plain, single-color square
> bricks?
>
> Are accuracy scores more beholden to one factor or the other?
>
> Does a supply of bad Lego bricks carry a higher risk of inaccuracy than a lack
> of creativity?

Imagine a genetically gifted individual raised in poverty, without access to
formal education, proper nutrition, or social stability. Such a person may fail
to fully express their cognitive potential. But—and this is crucial—providing
them with optimal conditions does not increase their genetic ceiling; it merely
allows them to approach it. The inverse is also true: placing an individual with
modest genetic endowment into ideal conditions will not produce brilliance. This
asymmetry reveals a troubling truth—public policy can mitigate cognitive
underdevelopment, but it cannot manufacture genius. Alchemy is dead for a
reason.

With a pile of plain yellow, crappy, chipped and broken, square Lego bricks,
Picasso may approach the high accuracy scores more successfully than the
uninspired IRS accountant, but the set of bricks assymetrically restricts the
score.

This shouldn't really be new information. Your body's parameters are foisted
upon you: your muscle size, physical health and metabolism have upper bounds. Do
all the bicep curls you want, the upper limit is determined not by how many you
do, but by how muscular your parents and grandparents were. Mental health is an
abstraction of the physical, so it too comes with limits: we all have our
genetic predispositions. It is no coincidence that the most effective and
dynamic interventions for entrenched mental health problems have been of the
_physical_ sort (yes, therapy can also be effective, but, therapy is _also_ a
[path to changing physical processes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4920136/)
in the brain).

These fact have serious implications for the way we think about educational
spending, social welfare, and upward mobility. If intelligence is predominantly
genetic, then our capacity to create a society of uniformly high performers is
fundamentally constrained. To nip both the respective typical conservative and
typical liberal arguments in the bud: it is not merely a question of will or
social program investment; it is a question of biology.

## Public Policy Implications

I tend to be in favor of preserving and building common-sense public goods,
utilizing public intervention when we can make a good case for it. Providing
pathways for education is a no-brainer, but I was under the impression that the
social reactionary arguments to heavy genetic influence on intelligence had it
_correct_: I thought that simply sending my kids to good schools will teach them
to be smart and successful. I am not sure I would have called myself a
subscriber to "Blank Slate" Theory (Steven Pinker
[argued compellingly against it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate)
and similar social theories, explaining some of the social campaigns in certain
fields of research), but I certainly thought the split between genes and
environment was closer to 50/50 than the roughly 80/20 split it seems to be. I
thought overhauling school systems, a not-so-uncommon political idea with
various attempts at execution over the years, was a legitimate, effective, and
simple solution (at least, relative to biological solutions) for getting
everyone into a higher economic class, potentiating success, and encouraging
individual achievement. While I will admit to having not thought extensively
about the relationship tying configuration of school systems and outcomes
together, it seems that my cursory notions were at best, naive.

In the middle of this book, I had a small crisis over my political and moral
views. I thought to myself: "Do many of our cherished social policies rest on
fiction? Even if we can intervene on intelligence in the future, what is the
point of good education systems _now_ if the upper limit of our custom,
genetically-configured intelligence can never be broken?" In other words, if the
best we can hope for is that by going to school you meet your full
genetically-bound potential, but not exceed or improve on it, then why dump
public money into a school system that won't ever do what it sets out to do:
increase intelligence? It would be like sending everyone to a soccer training
camp and expecting us all to have the potential of Lionel Messi. It seems like a
skewed expectation and goal.

Quite obviously, school deals with a lot more than just intelligence. It
provides opportunities for socialization, athletics, in some cases (very, very
sadly) the best nutrition or most positive attention that children will get all
week, novel experiences, et cetera, et cetera, so on and so forth. The list of
benefits school systems offer to personal development are long and obvious. In
light of what I am saying in this article, encouraging the approach of your
outer limits of ability, even if you cannot raise them, is also something
schools platform. I think society has a moral imperative to provide resources
for those who, through no fault of their own (because who in the flying f\*\*k
chooses to be disadvantaged by poverty or other debilitating hardships and
conditions?) to provide platforms and opportunities for increases in
socioeconomic status, leaving as few of our fellow humans behind in as we can.
Note that when I said "society has a moral imperative", by "society" I
specifically mean government and the public institutions it presides over; there
is no other entity to perform this function at the margins.

None of this means you eliminate the need for skills and merit and hard work to
discover the next miracle drug or cure for cancer, it simply means we have quite
conclusively established pathways and systems (school, access to healthcare,
good employment and income) that seem to afford people a better life. We should
give everyone every opportunity to intervene on their own circumstances. It's,
at base, a [Rawlsian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position)
framework, and yes, it's easy to speak in 10,000 foot high morals and much
harder to form legislation and policy around.

## Public Policy Dilemmas

Neurobiology is a promising path to intervene on certain conditions that may
contribute to socioeconomic status, intelligence being one among many. Look no
further than SSRIs or Adderall or, the newest miracle drug, semaglutide
(Ozempic), to see what can be provisionally achieved. What used to be
stigmatized, misdiagnosed, with sequelae misattributed to all sorts of false
proximate causes (most moral or philosphical instead of medical) is now
understood and, better yet, treated by these interventions.

But critics hold that neurobiology, a more-or-less fledgling field that deals in
hard-to-understand genes, their complex expressions and probabilites of
outcomes, is not the right thing to concentrate on right now; it doesn't yet
scale to public policy. As mentioned earlier, there is the gargantuan problem of
gene expression and environmental confounds. It is also true that we have much
more to uncover about the actual neurobiological underpinnings of intelligence
and yes, teasing all of this apart will take a year with progress stuck at its
current crawl. So, even with the full weight of experimental data suggesting
primacy of the genome over the environment, poverty reduction is logically the
procedurally superior intervention: it's just simply more practical.

## The Discomfort of Morality

It's not hard to see the risks to embracing this research path. History has
witnessed absolutely
[appalling and morally corrupt abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#After_1945)
of intelligence research—eugenics, forced sterilizations, and systemic
discrimination against perceived "inferior" populations. We must disentangle the
truth of intelligence from the crimes committed in its name.

While, in innumerable ways, our world is a better world than even a few short
decades ago(read one of my favorite
[books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now) ever on it if you don't
believe me), just skimming the current headlines and witnessing the idiocracy,
dumb political beliefs and
[alarming new political movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment)
might give you cause for doubting that we can behave responsibly with knowledge
on biological factors of intelligence. Or, your might even doubt we could use
whatever comes of such knowledge effectively. I mean, we're still trying to
convince people about basic, evidence-based findings surrounding things like
vaccines, the earth being round, or depression being a much more complicated
problem than a simple personality trait like laziness, for crying out loud. Even
modern intellectuals and researchers are mired in controversy surrounding
intelligence; just google Charles Murray or E.O. Wilson. Although, as an aside:
many of these researchers' views are also frequently misrepresented as saying
something they are not, and the state of research, as summarized by Haier,
suggests we should lower the pitchforks, suppress our moral gustatory reflex,
and have a real conversation about the current data.

And if that isn't bad enough, the elephant in the room: the current
administration has made anti-intellectualism and scoffing at expert, scientific
opinion a calling card. They have mangled, misrepresented and bastardized the
specifics of certain research projects funded by the government in order to make
them sound so ridiculous as to deride science _in general_. They have pulled
valuable funding from the NIH and other institutes, one of _the_ most productive
and prestigious scientific institutes in the world, seemingly unaware or
uncaring of the fact that government funding is responsible for some of the best
scientific projects and discoveries of our world. The sheer irresponsibility
with injecting politics into 21st century science is enough to make you want to
pack up all your shit and live on a remote island with no other people.

All of the above is to say: the hesitance is, if you ask me, probably one of the
most understandable things, well, ever. We live in a world populated by some
breathtakingly stupid ideas.

Even so, I would argue there is good reason to hope we might be alright. Many,
many more ethical bodies, laws, regulations, guiding medical boards, good
science organizations, and even the deep knowledge we have attained (which
directly refutes the morally corrupt claims that figures made in the past) won't
_allow_ us to retreat backwards unless all these relevant parties and
organizations somehow develop amnesia, forgetting their purposes and our moral
progress. Enlightenment, I am betting (and hoping), is here to stay, even if it
gets lost in the details of daily events. It's not a guarantee that there won't
be some crackpot who misrepresents the data to make invidious arguments, but in
my view:

1. That already happens today, both with
   [genetics](<https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(18)30363-X.pdf>) and in
   other arenas. Think race and crime statistics used to justify all manner of
   modern bogus theories, or different prejudices against mental health, sexual
   orientation, etc. We _certainly_ don't want more of it, but it wouldn't
   really introduce a new problem.
2. It seems a safe bet that good morals and science will continue to win out as
   they have over the last couple hundred years.

The key word in point 2 is "continue": good morals and science are what got us
to this more ethical stage of flourishing in the 21st century in the first
place. Life is just plain better than it was even 50 years ago, despite our
current struggles. Call me a naive optimist, but I am just following historical
trends.

As uncomfortable as this subject might be, and as conscientiously as we need to
traverse this field of research, we should remember: at the end of the day,
humans want to improve our circumstances. If we didn't, we'd still be living in
caves (here is
[an awesome read](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11382184-the-optimism-bias)
on the mechanisms behind this penchant for improvement) and it is, quite
objectively, a good thing we are not. _Everyone_ would take a pill to magically
improve their circumstances that inform wellbeing, with intelligently navigating
life being one such informant. We have been bending the universe, securing
flourishing for us and our descendents for hundreds of thousands of years. This
yearning for knowledge and the repudiation of stagnancy is at the basis of,
well, pretty much _all_ scientific endeavor, the genesis of which is the
Englightenment. The benefit of SSRIs, cancer treatements and other physical and
societal interventions are, to a one, borne of the will to improve our unplanned
participation in genetic and environmental lotteries.

The moral argument is quite simply: intervene if we can. We do not hesitate to
treat depression with SSRIs, cancer with chemotherapy, or diabetes with insulin.
And yet, when it comes to intelligence—a variable as biologically grounded as
any other—our moral inhibitions remain paralyzing. But the logic is no
different: if cognitive capacity profoundly influences life outcomes, then
improving cognitive capacity—whether through genetic engineering, the proximate
environmental causes of expression or other neurobiological intervention—is as
morally urgent as treating any other condition that diminishes human
flourishing. The question is not only one dealing with human potential: it is
one dealing with suffering, and suffering only absolves itself of necessity with
knowledge. Poverty, educational failure, chronic unemployment-these are not
merely social failings but poorly understood neurobiological ones (those who
attribute failings mainly to simple phenomena like laziness or individual will,
read that last sentence again).

We should want to toss out the chaotic, primordial genetic soup that birthed our
species; its expiration date has passed. Instead, let us adjust this soup's
recipe to an impactful genetic broth with maximal potential.

Suffering only absolves itself of necessity with knowledge.
