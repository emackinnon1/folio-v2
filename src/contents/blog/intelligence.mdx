Yes, the above quote is from _that_ Ronald Reagan. Oh, how far we have fallen,
eh?

The accelerating pace of neuroscience in the last few decades has yielded
extraordinary insights into the nature of human intelligence. What was once the
exclusive domain of philosophical conjecture—questions about the source,
stability, and limits of human cognition—has now become increasingly susceptible
to empirical inquiry. This shift, fueled by advances in neuroimaging,
psychometrics, and genetics, has overturned many of our long-held intuitions
about the mind and its potential. And yet, our discourse—both scientific and
public—has failed to fully integrate these findings, leaving us in a state of
moral and political dissonance.

Recently, I read _The Neuroscience of Intelligence_ (part of the Cambridge
series of neuroscience of psychology) by Richard Haier of the University of
California, Irvine, a sweeping overview of the study of intelligence. The book
is absolutely crammed with immense amounts of experiments, data,
interpretations, and theory; it's a lot to take in. Several of my moral and
philosphical presuppositions—those of intelligence, social outcomes, and the
malleability of individual potential-were exposed. Unsurprisingly, when I think
about it, the book augmented
[some other views](https://emackinnon.io/blog/determinism) I have. Reexamination
of assumptions is rarely a waste of time, however.

It is no small thing to realize that much of what we consider solvable through
intervention may, in fact, be underwritten by a genetic architecture far more
resistant to change than we had hoped. The implications are profound. If the
boundaries of intelligence are more constrained than commonly thought, it may be
that we need to rescope our ambitions for public policy and social programs. The
prevailing assumption has been that, with the right combination of investments
in education and social opportunity we can significantly uplift cognitive
outcomes across populations. I will flirt a bit with politics, but hopefully my
views are rational enough to be acceptable and worth thinking about, even if you
disagree on various levels.

# PFIT (Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory)

The core of Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory proposes that there are a number
of regions in the brain that underlie intelligent behavior and there is a clear,
structured flow, form and function. Evidence for PFIT is multidimensional,
resting on imaging research, lesion studies, and psychometrics. Sensory data
percolates through the parietal lobe and is elaborated on by the frontal lobe,
with interactions between the two generating evaluations and calculations and
the anterior cingulate cortex playing a role in inhibiting or promoting
responses. There is a general consensus that the PFIT is seen as the "best
available answer" to the question of "where" in the brain intelligence resides,
with a hint of "how" intelligence works.

Haier's overview teases out a few key concepts:

### Structure and Function

Intelligence is 100% biological, physical phenomenon. Variance in intelligence
is strongly linked to brain structures like gray matter, cortical thickness,
efficiency, and white matter ingegrity. Intelligence can be measured relatively
well through psychometrics and chronometrics, and is individually stable. While
limits seem stable, under nuanced circumstances like learning new skills, it may
be moderately improved in some areas. Less activity (in some regions and under
some circumstances) correlates to higher IQs in many cases (with some nuance),
suggesting that efficient networks play a part in intelligence. All of these
metrics are very predictive of certain outcomes like school achievements and
socioeconomic status (however, there is much to dig into and many confounds to
address with that correlation).

### Genes' Major Role

Data overwhelmingly points to genes and gene expression, not environment,
playing the major role in variance in intelligence. While the
genes-to-intelligence relationship remains controversial politically, it is not
so scientifically. We will benefit from reddressing valid concerns given past
historical misuses, terrible ethics of intelligence research and treatment of
disadvantaged research subjects. The most compelling evidence for genes'
dominant role is studies on identical twins raised apart and children raised in
different homes from their parents. This framework of children are considered a
gold standard for gene and gene expression studies. The correlation coefficient
of intelligence is about 77%, having been replicated time and time again with
increasingly large population studies. Despite the ongoing failure identify even
a single gene as one that is _definitively_ responsible for differences in
intelligence, Haier, via the experimental data relays that intelligence is _A)_
suspected by many to be pleiotropic and _B)_ broadly accepted as polygenic:
meaning _A)_ one intelligence gene could affect many dissimilar traits and _B)_
it is accepted that many genes contribute in a lot of small ways to overall
intelligence. Epigenetic variances remain a wrinkle to unravel, but even so, it
is clear that environment is operating on the biological material it has at
hand.

### Environment's Relevance

The same studies that point to genes' influence also point to environment
playing a role, but the role is nuanced. Nutrition, stable learning
environments, and socioeconomic status all influence cognitive development.
Early on, differences in environment account for a high percentage (around 75%
at age 5!) of differences of intelligence, but this drops to less 20 percent by
age 18. Environment platforms development, but its reach is weaker than once
believed. Early interventions, such as heavy investment in childhood programs,
with the goal of raising latent ability (with the most obvious outcome being
notably higher test scores), have been insipid and limited. With more
understanding of the biological substrate of intelligence, this could change.

### Enhancement is Limited

So far, putative intelligence improvement through brain-training and enhancement
abilities are limited, despite a robust industry built around this premise.
While it was hoped that we might find low cost, low effort interventions like
memory training or listening to Mozart, many experimental results have been at
best, overstated and underwhelming, and at worst, only offered modest but
temporary improvements. Hope seems to have trickled toward actual results
through intervention via biology, with some extremely interesting pathways are
in development. Check out
[DREADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand)
(classes of synthetic, engineered neuronal receptors that are activated and
inhibited through corresponding synthetic neurotransmitters) or
[optogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics) (activating and
inhibiting neurons and cells with light), to get tantalizing glimpses of a
future where brain function can be modified with precision. But for now, the
genetic architecture of intelligence remains remarkably stubborn.

### Neuroscience Could and Should Inform Policy

Intelligence and socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined at the
neurological level. Intelligence has a heritable component, but gene expression
is influenced by environmental factors, making it hard to attribute causal
direction in phenotypical traits of intelligence. Variance in intelligence
centers around many of the same neurological structures the socioeconomic status
(SES) tends to affect. For example: Lower SES is often associated with chronic
stress (e.g., financial instability, food insecurity, exposure to violence).
Chronic stress leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis and increased cortisol levels, which negatively impact brain
structures like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These same brain regions
are crucial for cognitive function and intelligence, meaning that SES-related
stress can influence cognitive abilities, profoundly blurring our understanding.
Haier argues that insight into the neuroscience of intelligence will lead to
better interventions on early childhood education leading to maximized
potentials.

# Genetics and the Limits of Malleability

I had a few of my assumptions disquietly rattled by Haier's summation of the
state of research. Familiar to me was that genes and their expression are the
supreme governors of our individual conditions, but what was _unfamiliar_ to me
how rigid intelligence is proving to be despite variance in environment. It
seems we have fewer broad levers at our disposal than has been impressed upon me
by the political conversations of our era, besides the basics of nutrition,
stress and poverty.

To be honest, all of this probably should not have been too much of a surprise
given findings like the
[ceiling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7243589/#:~:text=Abstract,fixed%20limit%20to%20longevity%20too)
we seem to have hit with longevity. If you have read one of my all time favorite
books in the world ever,
[Behave](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31170723-behave) by Robert
Sapolsky, it's even less of a surprise. Physical systems have rules and
boundaries, and while there is wiggle room, eventually you have to intervene on
the system itself to make changes. There is a difference between _realizing
potential_ and _enhancing potential_.

In case it is still a bit fuzzy (because, let's be honest, heritability can be
freaking confusing), we should hash out the finer points of the age-old "genes
vs environment" debate.

Imagine you are in a competition. You are going to build a life-sized replica of
the Sistine Chapel, ceiling and all, and will be scored on accuracy. The
accuracy score of the replica can represent intelligence scores, the art
supplies (clay, marble, sculpting tools, paint, paint brushes) you have
represent genes, and your creativity represents the environmental forces brought
to bear on the material art supplies. As is plain to see, accuracy scores boil
down to some combination of the quality and condition of supplies (genes) you
possess and your creative ability (environment). If you _really_ want to fill
out the analogy, the way your creativity influences how you use the supplies
themselves (maybe you modify the brush to result in a better paint stroke or use
a supply in an extremely unconventional way), might be something like
epigenetics, but we can ignore that notion for now.

You might see how, even if you aren't entirely sure that it's a 50/50 split
between art supplies and creativity that determines accuracy score, you could
form some questions to figure it out:

> How well would an IRS tax accountant, with all the creativity of a wooden
> board, do with all the best art supplies?
>
> How accurate could Picasso be with a single can of gray paint and some
> dried-out play-doh from the 80s?
>
> Are accuracy scores more beholden to one factor or the other?
>
> Does a supply of art supplies carry a higher risk of inaccuracy than a lack of
> creativity?

Imagine a genetically gifted individual raised in poverty, without access to
formal education, proper nutrition, or social stability. Such a person may fail
to fully express their cognitive potential. But—and this is crucial—providing
them with optimal conditions does not increase their genetic ceiling; it merely
allows them to approach it. The inverse is also true: placing an individual with
modest genetic endowment into ideal conditions will not produce brilliance. This
asymmetry reveals a troubling truth—public policy can mitigate cognitive
underdevelopment, but it cannot manufacture genius. Alchemy met its demise under
similar logic.

With a pile of shitty art supplies, Picasso may approach the high accuracy
scores more successfully than the uninspired IRS accountant would (this would
analogize to an improvement in environment), but the set of supplies is
assymetrically restrictive on accuracy score.

This shouldn't really be new information for a lot of us. We are all aware that
our body's parameters are foisted upon us: your muscle size, physical health and
metabolism have individually limited ranges. Do all the bicep curls you want,
but the upper limit of your arm muscles is determined not by how many you do,
but by how muscular your parents' and grandparents' biceps were. Mental health
is an abstraction of the physical, so too does it come with limits: we all have
our genetic predispositions. It is no coincidence that the explosion of
effective and dynamic interventions for entrenched mental health problems were
not during remedial Freudian or Jungian psychoanalytic and psychodynamic
theories' peak in popularity, but instead at the advent of systemic _physical_
interventions (caveat: therapy _can_ be effective, but therapy is _also_ a
[path to changing physical processes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4920136/)
in the brain).

These facts have serious implications for the way we think about educational
spending, social welfare, and upward mobility. If intelligence is predominantly
genetic, then our capacity to create a society of uniformly high performers rich
in ability is fundamentally constrained. To nip both the respective typical
conservative and typical liberal arguments in the bud: it is not merely a
question of will or program investment. It is a question of biology.

# Public Policy Implications

I tend to be in favor of building and preserving common-sense public goods,
utilizing public intervention when we can make a good case for it. Providing
pathways for education is a no-brainer, but I was under the impression that the
social reactionary arguments to heavy genetic influence on intelligence had it
_mostly_ correct: I thought, blithely, that sending my kids to good schools will
dictate their cleverness and success. To be honest, knowing how much I struggled
in school (for a number of reasons, I spectacularly failed out of my first high
school and barely made it through university), it is a deeply disconcerting
notion that those stages of my own life might be in some sense chained and
immobilized by my predispositions. How tightly coupled were those events to my
neurobiology? Naturally, concerns about what I pass on to any of my own children
follow in the wake of a question like that.

In the middle of this book I had a small crisis: Do many of our cherished social
policies rest on fiction? Even if we can intervene on intelligence in the
future, what is the point of good education systems _now_ if the upper limit of
our custom, genetically-configured intelligence can never be broken? In other
words, if the best we can hope for is that by going to school you meet your full
genetically-bound potential, but not exceed or improve on it, then why dump
public money into a school system that won't ever do what it sets out to do:
fundamentally increase ability? Are we doing the equivalent of sending everyone
to the NFL combine and expecting a room full of Tom Bradys?

While I will admit to having not thought _explicitly_ about the relationship
tying configuration of school systems, neurobiology and outcomes together, it
seems that my cursory notions were at best, naive. I am not sure I would have
called myself a subscriber to "Blank Slate" Theory (Steven Pinker
[argued compellingly against it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate)
and similar social theories, explaining some of the social campaigns in certain
fields of research), but I certainly thought the split between genes and
environment was closer to 50/50 than the roughly 80/20 split the data suggests
it to be. I thought overhauling school systems, a not-so-uncommon political idea
with various attempts at execution over the years, was a legitimate, effective,
and simple solution (at least, relative to biological solutions) for getting
everyone into a higher economic class, potentiating success, and encouraging
individual achievement.

Quite obviously, schooling and other similar early childhood development
programs involve a lot more than just intelligence. They visit benefits upon
participants by providing opportunities for socialization, athletics, in some
cases (very, _very_ sadly) the best nutrition or most positive attention that a
child will get all week, novel experiences, relief for overextended parents, et
cetera, et cetera, so on and so forth. It's a long list that justifies itself
many times over. And, even if good early childhood development platforms simply
allow realization instead of revolution of ability, that's another boon to add
to the list. Realization of potential is a worthy goal.

To touch on my own political views: I think society has a moral imperative to
provide resources for those who, through no fault of their own (because who in
the flying f\*\*k chooses to be disadvantaged by poverty or other debilitating
hardships and conditions?) to provide platforms and opportunities for increases
in socioeconomic status, leaving as few of our fellow humans behind in as we
can. Note that when I said "society has a moral imperative", by "society" I
specifically mean government and the public institutions it presides over; there
is no other entity to perform this function at the margins.

None of this means you eliminate the need for skills, merit and hard work to
discover the next miracle drug or cure for cancer-it simply means we have quite
conclusively established pathways and systems (school, access to healthcare,
good employment and income) that seem to afford people a better life. We should
give everyone every opportunity to intervene on their own circumstances. It's,
at base, a [Rawlsian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position)
framework, and yes, it's easy an thing to speak about in 10,000 foot high morals
and much harder to form legislation and policy around.

Better understanding leads to better interventions leads to better policy leads
to better lives and flourishing. It's a straightforward formula.

# Public Policy Dilemmas

Neurobiology is a promising path to intervene on certain conditions that may
contribute to socioeconomic status, intelligence being one among many. Look no
further than SSRIs or Adderall or, the newest miracle drug, semaglutide
(Ozempic), to see what can be provisionally achieved. What used to be
stigmatized, misdiagnosed, with sequelae misattributed to all sorts of false
proximate causes (most of them moral or philosphical instead of medical) is now
understood and, better yet, treated by these interventions.

But critics hold that neurobiology, a somewhat fledgling field in some of its
specifics, which deals in hard-to-understand genes, their complex expressions
and probabilites of outcomes, is not the right thing to concentrate on right
now-it doesn't yet scale to public policy. As mentioned earlier, there is the
gargantuan problem of intelligence and SES confound. Couple that with how in the
dark we are with the actual neurobiological underpinnings of intelligence and
the prospective years we have ahead of us of bumbling around at a snail's pace
trying to tease all of this apart, and it feels daunting. So, even with the full
weight of experimental data suggesting primacy of the genome over the
environment, poverty reduction is logically the procedurally superior
intervention: it's just simply more practical in many people's eyes. I certainly
see their point.

# The Discomfort of Morality

It's not hard to see the risks to embracing this research path. History has
witnessed innumerable
[appalling and morally corrupt abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#After_1945)
of intelligence research—eugenics, forced sterilizations, and systemic
discrimination against perceived "inferior" populations. We must disentangle the
truth of intelligence from the crimes committed in its name.

While, in innumerable ways, our world is a better world than even a few short
decades ago(read one of my favorite
[books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now) ever on it if you don't
believe me), just skimming the current headlines and witnessing the idiocracy,
dumb political beliefs and
[alarming new political movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment)
might give you cause for doubting that we can behave responsibly with knowledge
on biological factors of intelligence. Or, you might even distrust our ability
use whatever comes of such knowledge effectively. I mean, we're still trying to
convince people about basic, evidence-based findings surrounding things like
vaccines, the earth being round, or depression being a much more complicated
problem than a simple personality trait like laziness, for crying out loud. Even
modern intellectuals and researchers are mired in controversy surrounding
intelligence-just google Charles Murray or E.O. Wilson. Although, as an aside:
many of these researchers' views are also frequently misrepresented as saying
something they are not, and the state of research, as summarized by Haier,
suggests we should lower the pitchforks, suppress our gustatory reflex, and have
a real conversation about the current data.

And if all of doesn't give you pause... we can talk about the elephant in the
room: the current administration has made anti-intellectualism and scoffing at
expert, scientific opinion a calling card. They have mangled, misrepresented and
bastardized the specifics of certain research projects funded by the government
in order to make them sound so ridiculous as to deride science _in general_ or
use it to shove politics
[down our throats](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/states-push-fight-against-mrna-vaccines)
(although liberal politics rendered their own problems in academia). The admin
has pulled valuable funding from the NIH and other institutes, one of _the_ most
productive and prestigious scientific institutes in the world, seemingly unaware
or uncaring of the fact that government funding is responsible for some of the
best [scientific projects](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project) and
discoveries in our lifetimes. The sheer irresponsibility with injecting this
brand of politics into 21st century science is enough to make you want to pack
up all your shit, buy a boat, scream the lyrics to N.W.A.'s most
[enduring hit](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/5n8Aro6j1bEGIy7Tpo7FV7),
and risk attempting to join the Sentinal Islanders in their isolation.

All of the above is to say: the hesitance is, if you ask me, probably one of the
most understandable things, well, ever. We live in a world that platforms some
breathtakingly stupid ideas.

Even so, I would argue there is good reason to hope we might be alright. Many,
many more ethical bodies, laws, regulations, guiding medical boards, good
science organizations, and even the deep knowledge we have attained (which
directly refutes the morally corrupt claims that made) won't _allow_ us to
retreat backwards unless all these relevant parties and organizations somehow
develop amnesia, forget their purpose and toss our moral progress to the winds.
Enlightenment, I am betting (and hoping), is here to stay, even if it gets lost
in the details of daily headlines. It's not a guarantee that there won't be some
crackpot who misrepresents the data to make invidious arguments, but in my view:

- That already happens today, both with
  [genetics](<https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(18)30363-X.pdf>) and in
  other arenas. Think race and crime statistics used to justify all manner of
  modern bogus theories, or different prejudices against mental health, sexual
  orientation, etc. We _certainly_ don't want more of it, but it wouldn't really
  introduce a new problem.
- It seems a safe bet that good morals and science will continue to win out as
  they have over the last couple hundred years.

The key word in bullet point 2 is "continue": good morals and science are what
got us to this more ethical stage of flourishing in the 21st century in the
first place. Life is just plain better than it was even 50 years ago, despite
our current struggles. Call me a naive optimist, but I am just following
historical trends.

As uncomfortable as this subject might be, and as conscientiously as we need to
traverse this field of research, we should remember: at the end of the day,
humans want to improve our circumstances. If we didn't, we'd still be living in
caves (here is
[an awesome read](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11382184-the-optimism-bias)
on the mechanisms behind this penchant for improvement) and it is, quite
objectively, a good thing we are not still in caves. _Everyone_ would take a
pill to magically improve their circumstances that inform wellbeing, with
intelligently navigating life being one such informant. We have been bending the
universe, securing flourishing for us and our descendents for hundreds of
thousands of years. This yearning for knowledge and the repudiation of stagnancy
is at the basis of, well, pretty much _all_ scientific endeavor, the genesis of
which is the Englightenment. The benefit of SSRIs, cancer treatements and other
physical and societal interventions are, to a one, borne of the will to improve
our unconsenting participation in genetic and environmental lotteries.

The overarching moral argument with all of this is quite simply: intervene if we
can.

We do not hesitate to treat depression with SSRIs, cancer with chemotherapy, or
diabetes with insulin. And yet, when it comes to intelligence—a variable as
biologically grounded as any other—our moral inhibitions remain paralyzing. But
the logic is no different: if cognitive capacity profoundly influences life
outcomes, then improving cognitive capacity—whether through genetic engineering,
the proximate environmental causes of expression or other neurobiological
intervention—is as morally urgent as treating any other condition that
diminishes human flourishing. The question is not only one dealing with human
potential: it is one dealing with suffering, and suffering only absolves itself
of necessity with knowledge and progress. Poverty, educational failure, chronic
unemployment-these are not merely social failings but poorly understood
neurobiological ones (those who attribute failings mainly to simple phenomena
like laziness or individual will, read that last sentence again, and then read
it one more time).

We should want to toss out the chaotic, primordial genetic soup that birthed our
species; its expiration date has passed. Instead, let us adjust this soup's
recipe to an impactful genetic broth with maximal potential.
