In the past couple of decades, neuroscience has benefitted from an acceleration
in research funding, techniques, technology. We have uncovered an astonishingly
immense amount about the brain and how it works (with much, much more to
uncover) with much of that data informing theories that are both unmeasurably
interesting and practically significant.

Recently, I read two books that discussed theory of intelligence at the
neurological level: _The Neuroscience of Intelligence_ (part of the Cambridge
series of neuroscience of psychology) by Richard Haier and _A Thousand Brains: A
New Theory on Intelligence_ by Jeff Hawkins. Both of these theories on
intelligence compellingly explore, offer explanations and proffer future
pathways of research while carrying implications for current fields like A.I.,
public policy, and social programs.

# The Two theories

## PFIT (Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory)

Haier and his fellow researchers offer what, to those familiar with the brain,
is a more traditional view of neurological integration and processing. Evidence
for this theory is multidimensional, resting on imaging research, lesion
studies, and psychometrics. The theory proposes that there seem to be a number
of regions in the brain that underlie intelligent behavior and there seems to be
a clear, structured flow. Sensory data flows through the parietal lobe and is
elaborated on by the frontal lobe, with interactions between the two generating
evaluations and calculations, with the anterior cingulate cortex playing a role
in inhibiting or promotions responses. The PFIT is seen as the "best available
answer" to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides.

Haier's overview teases out a few key concepts:

#### Structure and function

Intelligence is strongly linked to brain structures like gray matter, cortical
thickness, efficiency, and white matter ingegrity. Intelligence is a physical
phenomenon, in part, can be measured through psychometrics and chronometrics,
and is relatively stable. Although, under nuanced circumstances like learning
new skills, it may be improved. Less activity (in some regions and under some
circumstances) correlates to higher IQs, suggesting that efficient networks play
a part in intelligence. All of these metrics are very predictive of certain
outcomes like schooling and socioeconomic status.

#### Genetics' major role

Data overwhelmingly points to genetics playing the major role in variance in
intelligence, but the genes-to-intelligence relationship remains controversial
politically, not scientifically. We will benefit from reddressing valid concerns
given past historical misuses and terrible ethics of intelligence research and
treatment of disadvantaged research subjects.

#### Environment's influence

The same studies that point to genes' influence also point to environment
playing a role in development of intelligence, but the influence is very
nuanced. Nutrition, stable learning environments, and socioeconomic status all
influence cognitive development. Early on, differences in environment account
for a high percentage (around 75% at age 5!) of differences in heritability of
intelligence, but this drops to less 20 percent by age 18 according to twin
studies (the gold standard for heritability studies). Early intervention in
childhood to improve outcomes, like public policy that invests heavily in
childhood schooling to improve test scores, has had very limited effects over
the long term.

#### Enhancement is limited

So far, putative intelligence improvement through brain-training and enhancement
abilities are limited, despite a heavy industry built around this idea. While it
was hoped that we might find low cost, low effort interventions like memory
training or listening to mozart, many findings have been overstated and
underwhelming. The real hope remains intervention through biology and some
extremely interesting pathways are in development (check out
[DREADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand),
a method for designing synthetic neuronal receptors and activating them through
synthetic transmitters)

#### Neuroscience should inform policy

Intelligence and socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined at the
neurological level. Intelligence has a heritable component, but gene expression
is influenced by environmental factors which makes it hard to tell the causal
direction as both phenomena are associated with differences in the same
neurological structures. For example: Lower SES is often associated with chronic
stress (e.g., financial instability, food insecurity, exposure to violence).
Chronic stress leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis and increased cortisol levels, which negatively impact brain
structures like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These same brain regions
are crucial for cognitive function and intelligence, meaning that SES-related
stress can influence cognitive abilities, further blurring the distinction
between SES and intelligence. Haier argues that understanding the neuroscience
of intelligence will lead to better interventions on early childhood education
leading to maximized potentials.

## Thousand Brains Theory

Jeff Hawkins posits that instead of a hierachical, more-or-less serial
processing, much of humans' high capacity for abstract thought and intelligence
comes down to simultaneous parallel processing and simple neurological
algorithms that elegantly scale to complex thought. His theory centers on a few
core ideas:

#### Cortical columns

Cortical columns are the engine of the afore-mentioned simple algorithms. We
have about 150,000 of these in the neocortex, all of which are independent
learning processing units. The cortical columns are distributed and parallel,
with multiple columns interacting simultaneously and collaboratively.

### Models of the world

Each cortical column independently models different features and patterns of the
world (when you see a coffee cup, different cortical columns process shape,
texture, and other properties independently). Each feature is modeled from
different inputs, whether from the cortical regions that detect curvature versus
straight lines, the different fingers on a hand, or from different sensors
altogether, (eyes versus skin). These features are integrated, combining local
perspectives into global understanding.

#### Reference Frames

Hawkins argues that this allows us to operate on "reference frames", mental maps
that help us understand the world through structure, spatial relations and
temporal schemas. The key insight here is the understanding of
[grid cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_cell), which are neurons that
operate in the older entorhinal cortex, allowing you to represent location of a
body in an environment. Hawkins and team propose that grid cells are present in
the newer neocortex, defining a _location-based_ framework. This means that the
same substrate of abstraction driving grid cells drives is employed by the
neocortex to learn the structure of objects, not only what they are, but also
how they behave.

This theory of intelligence is very different from neural networks, which are
based on a classic view of sensory inputs being processed in a series of steps,
with the assumption that complete objects are recognized at a certain level of
the hierarchy where cells take in the entire sensory array. In other words, the
classic view has a coffee cup appear at a certain step of processing, but not
before. The image on your computer screen appears _after_ getting signal inputs
from a CPU, _then_ getting rendered by a GPU, and being sent as pixels mapped to
points on a screen.

Conversely, Thousand Brains proffers that each cortical column creates complete
models of its world, based on what it can sense as its associated sensor moves.
Columns combine their models in real time; as each column comes online with
sensory input, features of an object get integrated as grid cell-derived
locations over movements.

"_The very act of thinking is a form of movement_", he says in his book. Quite a
stunningly rendered abstraction.

To illustrate using the researchers' example, imagine touching a coffee cup with
a finger. When you move your finger over different its surface, you
conceptualize and model it, localizing the different sensations you receive,
like the curve of the lip or flatness of the bottom, relative to location on the
cup. When you use a finger from your other hand to trace the contours, you don't
have to relearn the sensation-to-location relationship, the object's relative
models of sensations now exist and allow for predictions. If you were to grasp
the cup with your whole hand, multiple locations' sensory input are
parallelized. The columns of each finger on their own don't have enough
information to identify the cup, but more independent inputs equates to more
location-sensory context and allow the columns to "vote" to identify the object
more quickly. Cross sensory processing occurs between senses like touch and
vision, permitting richer "voting". The existence of these low level connections
directly between the different sensory processing regions (which have been
confirmed) don't make sense in the hierarchical models, but they are part and
parcel for the Thousand Brains theory.
