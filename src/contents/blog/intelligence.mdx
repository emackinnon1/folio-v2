In the past couple of decades, neuroscience has benefitted from an acceleration
in research funding, techniques, technology. We have uncovered an astonishingly
immense amount about the brain and how it works (with much, much more to
uncover) with much of that data informing theories that are both unmeasurably
interesting and practically significant.

Recently, I read a books that discussed theory of intelligence at the
neurological level: _The Neuroscience of Intelligence_ (part of the Cambridge
series of neuroscience of psychology) by Richard Haier. This book shook a few of
my foundational views dispositions on several matters. Reexamination is never a
bad thing, though. The implications for public policy and social programs,
realistic goals and, really, where to aim my hopes for myself and others are now
seen under a new lens. I promise I won't get deep into the nitty gritty of
political views, but I will examine some of the usual solutions and policy ideas
that come from the different factions of American politics.

## PFIT (Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory)

Evidence for PFIT is multidimensional, resting on imaging research, lesion
studies, and psychometrics. The theory proposes that there seem to be a number
of regions in the brain that underlie intelligent behavior and there seems to be
a clear, structured flow. Sensory data flows through the parietal lobe and is
elaborated on by the frontal lobe, with interactions between the two generating
evaluations and calculations, with the anterior cingulate cortex playing a role
in inhibiting or promotions responses. The PFIT is seen as the "best available
answer" to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides.

Haier's overview teases out a few key concepts:

#### Structure and function

Intelligence is 100% biological, physical phenomenon. Variance in intelligence
is strongly linked to brain structures like gray matter, cortical thickness,
efficiency, and white matter ingegrity. Intelligence can be measured relatively
well through psychometrics and chronometrics, and is individually stable.
Although, under nuanced circumstances like learning new skills, it may be
improved. Less activity (in some regions and under some circumstances)
correlates to higher IQs in many cases (with some nuance), suggesting that
efficient networks play a part in intelligence. All of these metrics are very
predictive of certain outcomes like schooling and socioeconomic status (however,
there is much to dig into there and many confounds to address).

#### Genes' major role

Data overwhelmingly points to genes and gene expression, not environment,
playing the major role in variance in intelligence. While the
genes-to-intelligence relationship remains controversial politically, it is not
so scientifically. We will benefit from reddressing valid concerns given past
historical misuses and terrible ethics of intelligence research and treatment of
disadvantaged research subjects. The most compelling evidence for this is
studies on identical twins raised apart and children raised in different homes
from their parents. These are considered a gold standard for gene and gene
expression studie. The correlation coefficient of intelligence is about 77% and
has been replicated time and time again with large population studies. Despite
failure to identify a single gene as one that _definitively_ is responsible for
differences in intelligence, Haier relays that intelligence is _A)_ possibly
pleiotropic and _B)_ broadly accepted as polygenic: meaning _A)_ one
intelligence gene could affect many dissimilar traits and _B)_ it is accepted
that many genes contribute in a lot of small ways to overall intelligence.
Epigenetic variances remain a wrinkle to unravel, but even so, it is clear that
environment is operating on the biological material it has at hand.

#### Environment's influence

The same studies that point to genes' influence also point to environment
playing a role in development of intelligence, but the influence is very
nuanced. Nutrition, stable learning environments, and socioeconomic status all
influence cognitive development. Early on, differences in environment account
for a high percentage (around 75% at age 5!) of differences of intelligence, but
this drops to less 20 percent by age 18. Environment plays a part, but it does
not play a part as strongly as we once believed. Early intervention in childhood
to improve outcomes, like public policy that invests heavily in childhood
schooling to improve test scores, has had very limited effects over the long
term so far. With more understanding of gene expression in relation to
intelligence, this could change.

#### Enhancement is limited

So far, putative intelligence improvement through brain-training and enhancement
abilities are limited, despite a heavy industry built around this idea. While it
was hoped that we might find low cost, low effort interventions like memory
training or listening to Mozart, many findings have been overstated and
underwhelming. The real hope remains intervention through biology and some
extremely interesting pathways are in development (check out
[DREADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand),
a method for designing synthetic neuronal receptors and activating them through
synthetic transmitters).

#### Neuroscience should inform policy

Intelligence and socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined at the
neurological level. Intelligence has a heritable component, but gene expression
is influenced by environmental factors which makes it hard to tell the causal
direction. Both phenomena are associated with differences in the _same_
neurological structures. For example: Lower SES is often associated with chronic
stress (e.g., financial instability, food insecurity, exposure to violence).
Chronic stress leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis and increased cortisol levels, which negatively impact brain
structures like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These same brain regions
are crucial for cognitive function and intelligence, meaning that SES-related
stress can influence cognitive abilities, further blurring the distinction
between SES and intelligence. Haier argues that understanding the neuroscience
of intelligence will lead to better interventions on early childhood education
leading to maximized potentials.

## Immediate implications

I had a few of my views absolutely _shattered_ by Haier's summation of the state
of research. Familiar to me was that genes and their expression are the supreme
governors of our individual conditions, but what was _unfamiliar_ to me was how
few broad environmental levers we have at our disposal, besides the basics of
nutrition, stress and poverty, to _influence_ those expressions.

To be honest, all of this probably should not have been too much of a surprise
given findings like the
[ceiling we seem to have hit with longevity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7243589/#:~:text=Abstract,fixed%20limit%20to%20longevity%20too).
Physical systems have rules and boundaries, and while there is wiggle room,
eventually you have to intervene on the system itself to make changes.

Your body's parameters are foisted upon you; workout all you want, but your
muscle size, physical health and metabolism have upper bounds. Mental health is
an abstraction of physical health, so it comes with limits, too. It is no
coincidence that the most effective and dynamic interventions for entrenched
mental health problems have been physical interventions (not to say therapy
isn't effective, but while therapy also is, at a certain level, changing
physical processes in the brain, the point is it can only do so much without
deeper measures). To break through the gene-imposed limits on phenotypical
features like muscle size, metabolism, hormones, mental health and physical
health, you need steroids, amphetamines, androgens, SSRIs and medicine,
respectively. It's becoming obvious (and should have been obvious to the general
public) that intelligence is another trait bound by the same laws. Alchemy is
dead for a reason.

In case it is still a bit fuzzy (it's freakin' confusing), I will use an analogy
to talk about what is meant by genes driving the variance in intelligence in the
context of the genes vs environment debate. Imagine you have a set of legos and
you want to build the most high level structure you can think of. We will say
that the legos represent genes and maybe the creativity you have or the giant
box of different lego set instructions you possess might roughly represent the
environment.

# Public policy

I tend to be in favor of preserving and building common-sense public goods,
utilizing public intervention when we can make a good case for it. Providing
pathways for education is a no-brainer to me and I was under the impression that
the reactionary arguments to heavy genetic influence on intelligence were
_right_: I thought that simply sending my kids to good schools will teach them
to be smart and successful. I am not sure I would have called myself a
subscriber to "Blank Slate" Theory (Steven Pinker
[argued compellingly against it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate)
and similar social theories, explaining some of the social campaigns in certain
fields of research), but I certainly thought the split between genes and
environment was closer to 50/50 than the roughly 80/20 split it seems to be. I
thought overhauling school systems, a not-so-uncommon political idea with
various attempts at execution over the years, was a legitimate, effective, and
simple solution (at least, relative to biological solutions) for getting
everyone into a higher economic class, potentiating success, and encouraging
individual achievement. It seems I was... naive. None of this is very simple.

In the middle of this book, I had a small crisis over my political and moral
views. I thought to myself: "Even if we can intervene on intelligence in the
future, what is the point of good education systems _now_ if the upper limit of
our custom, genetically-configured intelligence can never be broken?" In other
words, if the best we can hope for is that by going to school you meet your full
genetically-bound potential, but not exceed or improve on it, then why dump
public money into a school system that won't ever do what it sets out to do:
increase intelligence? It would be like sending everyone to some sort of soccer
training camp and expecting us all to have the potential of Messi, therefore
coming back as superstars. It seems like a skewed expectation and goal.

Now, quite obviously, school deals with a lot more than just intelligence. It
provides opportunities for socialization, athletics, relationship building, in
some cases, unfortunately, the best nutrition that children will get during
their week, novel experiences and other personal development. I think government
and the public institutions it presides over have a moral imperative to provide
resources for those who, by no fault of their own (because who in the world
chooses disadvantages like poverty or other debilitating conditions? Read my
[last post](https://emackinnon.io/blog/determinism) for relevant thoughts), to
provide platforms and opportunities for increases socioeconomic status. This
doesn't mean you eliminate the need for skilled professionals and researchers
and merit and hard work to discover the next miracle drug or cure for cancer; it
means we have established pathways and systems that seem to afford people a
better life, give everyone every opportunity to intervene on their own
circumstances. It's at base,
[Rawlsian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position). This is a view that
encompasses more than public school systems and their noble (but maybe naive?)
goals to increase intelligence through good developmental environment. There is
a fair amount to dig into and qualify for me, but broadly, it's my starting
position.

What is the point of the fruits we have obtained with building our potential for
flourishing if we don't open up the opportunity to _anyone_ who could benefit
from it? We can, and we should, even if some don't take it. Should we offer
treatment to everyone who suffers from alcoholism, even if they don't take us up
on it? I'll share that I certainly didn't take full advantage of school. In fact
I spectacularly failed out of my first high school and was a terrible student
when I finally got to college. But despite my struggles, I got immense use out
of an eventual degree, the socialization aspects, and the skills that I had to
learn to pass my classes. For all its problems (and there are _many_), the
education system in this country is undeniably a good thing.

## Criticisms on neurobiology as the right path

Neurobiology is a promising path to intervene on certain conditions that may
contribute to socioeconomic status, intelligence being one among many. Look no
further than SSRIs or Adderall or, the newest miracle drug, semaglutide
(Ozempic), to see the fruits of our labor. What used to be stigmatized is now
understood and, better yet, treated.

But critics hold that neurobiology, a fledgling field that deals in
hard-to-understand genes and their complex expressions, is the right thing to
concentrate on right now. There is the massive problem of the confounding of
genes and environment influences on the _expression_ of those genes.

## Morality of intelligence research

It's not hard to see the risks to embracing this research path. It's not a new
argument either: abuse and mistreatment on the grounds of intelligence wouldn't
be the first time humans have attempted such a repugnant political pogrom. We
have a long history of terrible regimes justifying horrible treatment of
populations seen as "inferior". This time, we would really have real, better
data. In ages past (even as recently as the
[20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#After_1945)),
these same arguments were made on the back of a lot of propaganda and completely
unethical, bad science driven by agenda instead of genuine pursuit for truth.

While, in innumerable ways, our world is not the same world as even just a few
decades ago (read one of my favorite
[books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now) ever on it if you don't
believe me), just skimming the current headlines and witnessing the idiocracy
and dumb political beliefs might give you cause for doubting that we can behave
responsibly with knowledge on biological factors of intelligence. Or, your might
even doubt we could use it effectively. I mean, we're still trying to convince
people about basic, evidence-based findings surrounding things like vaccines,
the earth being round, or depression being a much more complicated problem than
a simple personality trait like laziness, for crying out loud. Even modern
intellectuals and researchers are mired in controversy surrounding intelligence;
just google Charles Murray or E.O. Wilson (although I will say, many views are
also frequently misrepresented as saying something they are not).

All of that is to say: the hesitance is, if you ask me, probably one of the most
understandable things, well, ever.

Even so, I would argue the landscape isn't quite the same now. Many, many more
ethical bodies, laws, regulations, guiding medical boards, science
organizations, and even the deep knowledge we have attained (which directly
refutes the morally corrupt claims that figures made in the past) won't _allow_
us to go backwards unless all these relevant parties somehow develop amnesia.
Enlightenment, I am betting (and hoping), is here to stay. It's not a guarantee
that there won't be some crackpot who misrepresents the data to make invidious
arguments, but in my view:

1. That already happens today, both with
   [genetics](<https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(18)30363-X.pdf>) and in
   other arenas (think race and crime statistics used to justify all manner of
   modern bogus theories). We _certainly_ don't want more of it, but it wouldn't
   introduce a new problem (yes, that might be a paltry defense on its own).
2. It seems a safe bet that good morals and science will continue to win out as
   they have over the last couple hundred years.

The key word in point 2 is "continue", as good morals and science are what got
us to this more ethical stage of flourishing in the 21st century in the first
place. Call me a naive optimist, but I am just following historical trends.

At the end of the day, humans want to improve our circumstances. If we didn't,
we'd still be living in caves. We have been bending the universe, securing
flourishing for us and our descendents for hundreds of thousands of years. This
drive is at the basis of, well, pretty much _all_ scientific endeavor, the
genesis of which is the Englightenment. The benefit of SSRIs, cancer treatements
and other physical and societal interventions are, to a one, borne of the will
to improve our unplanned genetic and environmental lotteries. Therefore,
improving understanding of biological and genetic bases for intelligence is an
extension of improving understanding of biological and genetic bases for
depression, cancer and other ailments and physical conditions outside of our
control.

The moral argument is quite simply: intervene if we can. If poverty or
near-poverty has some of its roots in neurobiology beyond anyone's control, it
is _right and just_ to impede on it. We should want to toss out the chaotic,
primordial genetic soup that birthed our species; its expiration date has
passed. Instead, let us adjust this soup's recipe to an impactful genetic broth
with maximal potential.

Suffering only shifts its necessity with knowledge.

How do you make morals around known limits? This changes the idea of _should_.
