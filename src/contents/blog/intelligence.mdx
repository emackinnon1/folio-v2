In the past couple of decades, neuroscience has benefitted from an acceleration
in research funding, techniques, technology. We have uncovered an astonishingly
immense amount about the brain and how it works (with much, much more to
uncover) with much of that data informing theories that are both unmeasurably
interesting and practically significant.

Recently, I read two books that discussed theory of intelligence at the
neurological level: _The Neuroscience of Intelligence_ (part of the Cambridge
series of neuroscience of psychology) by Richard Haier and _A Thousand Brains: A
New Theory on Intelligence_ by Jeff Hawkins. Both of these theories on
intelligence compellingly explore, offer explanations and proffer future
pathways of research while carrying implications for current fields like A.I.,
public policy, and social programs.

# The Two theories

## PFIT (Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory)

Haier and his fellow researchers offer what, to those familiar with the brain,
is a more traditional view of neurological integration and processing. Evidence
for this theory is multidimensional, resting on imaging research, lesion
studies, and psychometrics. The theory proposes that there seem to be a number
of regions in the brain that underlie intelligent behavior and there seems to be
a clear, structured flow. Sensory data flows through the parietal lobe and is
elaborated on by the frontal lobe, with interactions between the two generating
evaluations and calculations, with the anterior cingulate cortex playing a role
in inhibiting or promotions responses. The PFIT is seen as the "best available
answer" to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides.

Haier's overview teases out a few key concepts:

#### Structure and function

Intelligence is strongly linked to brain structures like gray matter, cortical
thickness, efficiency, and white matter ingegrity. Intelligence is a physical
phenomenon, in part, can be measured through psychometrics and chronometrics,
and is relatively stable. Although, under nuanced circumstances like learning
new skills, it may be improved. Less activity (in some regions and under some
circumstances) correlates to higher IQs, suggesting that efficient networks play
a part in intelligence. All of these metrics are very predictive of certain
outcomes like schooling and socioeconomic status.

#### Genetics' major role

Data overwhelmingly points to genetics playing the major role in variance in
intelligence, but the genes-to-intelligence relationship remains controversial
politically, not scientifically. We will benefit from reddressing valid concerns
given past historical misuses and terrible ethics of intelligence research and
treatment of disadvantaged research subjects.

#### Environment's influence

The same studies that point to genes' influence also point to environment
playing a role in development of intelligence, but the influence is very
nuanced. Nutrition, stable learning environments, and socioeconomic status all
influence cognitive development. Early on, differences in environment account
for a high percentage (around 75% at age 5!) of differences in heritability of
intelligence, but this drops to less 20 percent by age 18 according to twin
studies (the gold standard for heritability studies). Early intervention in
childhood to improve outcomes, like public policy that invests heavily in
childhood schooling to improve test scores, has had very limited effects over
the long term.

#### Enhancement is limited

So far, putative intelligence improvement through brain-training and enhancement
abilities are limited, despite a heavy industry built around this idea. While it
was hoped that we might find low cost, low effort interventions like memory
training or listening to mozart, many findings have been overstated and
underwhelming. The real hope remains intervention through biology and some
extremely interesting pathways are in development (check out
[DREADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand),
a method for designing synthetic neuronal receptors and activating them through
synthetic transmitters).

#### Neuroscience should inform policy

Intelligence and socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined at the
neurological level. Intelligence has a heritable component, but gene expression
is influenced by environmental factors which makes it hard to tell the causal
direction as both phenomena are associated with differences in the same
neurological structures. For example: Lower SES is often associated with chronic
stress (e.g., financial instability, food insecurity, exposure to violence).
Chronic stress leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis and increased cortisol levels, which negatively impact brain
structures like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These same brain regions
are crucial for cognitive function and intelligence, meaning that SES-related
stress can influence cognitive abilities, further blurring the distinction
between SES and intelligence. Haier argues that understanding the neuroscience
of intelligence will lead to better interventions on early childhood education
leading to maximized potentials.
