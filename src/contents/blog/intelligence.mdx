In the past couple of decades, neuroscience has benefited from an acceleration
in research funding, techniques, and technology. We have uncovered an
astonishingly immense amount about the brain and how it works (with much, much
more to uncover) with much of that data informing theories that are both
unmeasurably interesting and practically significant.

Recently, I read _The Neuroscience of Intelligence_ (part of the Cambridge
series of neuroscience of psychology) by Richard Haier. This book rattled a few
of my foundational dispositions on several matters. Reexamination is never a bad
thing, though. The implications for public policy and social programs, realistic
goals and, really, where to aim my hopes for myself and others are now seen
under a new lens, and for that are a bit more in focus. The book,
unsurprisingly, when I think about it, augments
[some other views](https://emackinnon.io/blog/determinism) I have. I promise I
won't get deep into the nitty gritty of political views, but I will examine some
of the usual solutions and policy thrusts that come from the different factions
of American politics.

## PFIT (Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory)

Evidence for PFIT is multidimensional, resting on imaging research, lesion
studies, and psychometrics. The theory proposes that there seem to be a number
of regions in the brain that underlie intelligent behavior and there seems to be
a clear, structured flow, form and function. Sensory data percolates through the
parietal lobe and is elaborated on by the frontal lobe, with interactions
between the two generating evaluations and calculations, with the anterior
cingulate cortex playing a role in inhibiting or promotions responses. The PFIT
is seen as the "best available answer" to the question of where in the brain
intelligence resides.

Haier's overview teases out a few key concepts:

#### Structure and function

Intelligence is 100% biological, physical phenomenon. Variance in intelligence
is strongly linked to brain structures like gray matter, cortical thickness,
efficiency, and white matter ingegrity. Intelligence can be measured relatively
well through psychometrics and chronometrics, and is individually stable.
Although, under nuanced circumstances like learning new skills, it may be
improved. Less activity (in some regions and under some circumstances)
correlates to higher IQs in many cases (with some nuance), suggesting that
efficient networks play a part in intelligence. All of these metrics are very
predictive of certain outcomes like schooling and socioeconomic status (however,
there is much to dig into there and many confounds to address).

#### Genes' major role

Data overwhelmingly points to genes and gene expression, not environment,
playing the major role in variance in intelligence. While the
genes-to-intelligence relationship remains controversial politically, it is not
so scientifically. We will benefit from reddressing valid concerns given past
historical misuses and terrible ethics of intelligence research and treatment of
disadvantaged research subjects. The most compelling evidence for this is
studies on identical twins raised apart and children raised in different homes
from their parents. These are considered a gold standard for gene and gene
expression studie. The correlation coefficient of intelligence is about 77% and
has been replicated time and time again with large population studies. Despite
failure to identify a single gene as one that _definitively_ is responsible for
differences in intelligence, Haier relays that intelligence is _A)_ possibly
pleiotropic and _B)_ broadly accepted as polygenic: meaning _A)_ one
intelligence gene could affect many dissimilar traits and _B)_ it is accepted
that many genes contribute in a lot of small ways to overall intelligence.
Epigenetic variances remain a wrinkle to unravel, but even so, it is clear that
environment is operating on the biological material it has at hand.

#### Environment's influence

The same studies that point to genes' influence also point to environment
playing a role in development of intelligence, but the influence is very
nuanced. Nutrition, stable learning environments, and socioeconomic status all
influence cognitive development. Early on, differences in environment account
for a high percentage (around 75% at age 5!) of differences of intelligence, but
this drops to less 20 percent by age 18. Environment plays a part, but it does
not play a part as strongly as we once believed. Early intervention in childhood
to improve outcomes, like public policy that invests heavily in childhood
schooling to improve test scores, has had very limited effects over the long
term so far. With more understanding of gene expression in relation to
intelligence, this could change.

#### Enhancement is limited

So far, putative intelligence improvement through brain-training and enhancement
abilities are limited, despite a heavy industry built around this idea. While it
was hoped that we might find low cost, low effort interventions like memory
training or listening to Mozart, many findings have been overstated and
underwhelming. The real hope remains intervention through biology and some
extremely interesting pathways are in development (check out
[DREADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand),
classes of synthetic, engineered neuronal receptors that activated through
synthetic transmitters).

#### Neuroscience should inform policy

Intelligence and socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined at the
neurological level. Intelligence has a heritable component, but gene expression
is influenced by environmental factors which makes it hard to tell the causal
direction phenotypical traits. Variance in intelligence centers around many of
the same neurological structures the socioeconomic status (SES) tends to affect.
For example: Lower SES is often associated with chronic stress (e.g., financial
instability, food insecurity, exposure to violence). Chronic stress leads to
dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased
cortisol levels, which negatively impact brain structures like the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex. These same brain regions are crucial for cognitive
function and intelligence, meaning that SES-related stress can influence
cognitive abilities, blurring things quite profoundly. Haier argues that
understanding the neuroscience of intelligence will lead to better interventions
on early childhood education leading to maximized potentials.

## Immediate implications

I had a few of my views absolutely _shattered_ by Haier's summation of the state
of research. Familiar to me was that genes and their expression are the supreme
governors of our individual conditions, but what was _unfamiliar_ to me was how
few broad environmental levers we have at our disposal, besides the basics of
nutrition, stress and poverty, to _influence_ those expressions.

To be honest, all of this probably should not have been too much of a surprise
given findings like the
[ceiling we seem to have hit with longevity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7243589/#:~:text=Abstract,fixed%20limit%20to%20longevity%20too).
Physical systems have rules and boundaries, and while there is wiggle room,
eventually you have to intervene on the system itself to make changes.

In case it is still a bit fuzzy (because, let's be honest, heritability can be
freakin' confusing), we should hash out the finer points of the age-old "genes
vs environment" debate.

Imagine you are in a Lego building competition. You are going to build a
life-sized replica of the Sistine Chapel, ceiling and all, and will be scored on
accuracy. The accuracy score of the replica can represent intelligence scores,
the individual Legos blocks in the set you are given represent genes, and your
creativity represents the environmental forces brought to bear on the Legos. As
is plain to see, accuracy scores boil down to some combination of the set of
legos bricks (genes) you have and your creative ability (environment). If you
_really_ want to fill out the analogy, the way your creativity influences how
you use the bricks themselves (maybe you modify them by hand or use them in
extremely unconventional ways), might be something like epigenetics, but we can
ignore that part for now.

You might see how, even if you aren't entirely sure that it's a 50/50 split
between Legos and creativity that determines accuracy score, you could form some
questions to figure it out:

> - How well would a boring IRS tax accountant do with all the best Lego pieces
>   you could use to build the Sistine Chapel?
> - How accurate could Picasso be with a bunch of plain, square yellow bricks?
> - Are accuracy scores more beholden to one factor or the other? Does a supply
>   of bad Lego bricks carry a higher risk of inaccuracy than a lack of
>   creativity?

At a high level, consider 3 people: a really smart person, a person of average
intelligence, and well-below-average intelligence. The differences between them
are not **_mainly caused_** (key words) by the smart one being raised in an
upper class environment of low-stress, good schooling, and nutrition, the
average person being raised in a middle/working class environment with good, but
not great, schooling, some stress, and decent nutrition, and the least
intelligent person being raised in an environment with none of those things. It
means that the main variable is the genome (and we are currently figuring out
what the genome does _under certain conditions_, which is the purview of
epigenetics), so if you take the smart one and stick them in a poor environment,
they might not pop out with _exactly_ at the same level of ability, but it would
be a near thing. Equivalent to giving Picasso a bunch of yellow bricks to build
the Sistine Chapel. The material nature of the building blocks is restrictive of
outcomes.

Your body's parameters are foisted upon you; workout all you want, but your
muscle size, physical health and metabolism have upper bounds. Mental health is
an abstraction of physical health, so it comes with limits, too. It is no
coincidence that the most effective and dynamic interventions for entrenched
mental health problems have been physical interventions (yes, therapy can also
be effective, but, therapy is changing physical processes in the brain, so it
rests comfortably on the spectrum of "system changes"). To break through the
gene-imposed limits on phenotypical features like muscle size, metabolism,
hormones, mental health and physical health, you need steroids, amphetamines,
androgens, SSRIs and medicine, respectively. It's becoming obvious (and should
have been obvious to the general public) that intelligence is another trait
bound by the same laws.

Alchemy is dead for a reason.

# Public policy

I tend to be in favor of preserving and building common-sense public goods,
utilizing public intervention when we can make a good case for it. Providing
pathways for education is a no-brainer, but I was under the impression that the
socialreactionary arguments to heavy genetic influence on intelligence had it
_right_: I thought that simply sending my kids to good schools will teach them
to be smart and successful. I am not sure I would have called myself a
subscriber to "Blank Slate" Theory (Steven Pinker
[argued compellingly against it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate)
and similar social theories, explaining some of the social campaigns in certain
fields of research), but I certainly thought the split between genes and
environment was closer to 50/50 than the roughly 80/20 split it seems to be. I
thought overhauling school systems, a not-so-uncommon political idea with
various attempts at execution over the years, was a legitimate, effective, and
simple solution (at least, relative to biological solutions) for getting
everyone into a higher economic class, potentiating success, and encouraging
individual achievement. It seems I was... naive. None of this is very simple.

In the middle of this book, I had a small crisis over my political and moral
views. I thought to myself: "Even if we can intervene on intelligence in the
future, what is the point of good education systems _now_ if the upper limit of
our custom, genetically-configured intelligence can never be broken?" In other
words, if the best we can hope for is that by going to school you meet your full
genetically-bound potential, but not exceed or improve on it, then why dump
public money into a school system that won't ever do what it sets out to do:
increase intelligence? It would be like sending everyone to a soccer training
camp and expecting us all to have the potential of Lionel Messi. It seems like a
skewed expectation and goal.

Quite obviously, school deals with a lot more than just intelligence. It
provides opportunities for socialization, athletics, in some cases (very, very
sadly) the best nutrition or most positive attention that children will get all
week, novel experiences, et cetera, et cetera, so on and so forth. The list of
benefits school systems offer to personal development are long and obvious. I
think society (which means the government and the public institutions it
presides over, for lack of a better choice) has a moral imperative to provide
resources for those who, by no fault of their own (because who in the world
chooses disadvantages like poverty or other debilitating conditions?), to
provide platforms and opportunities for increases socioeconomic status, leaving
as few behind in this world as we can. This doesn't mean you eliminate the need
for skilled professionals and researchers and merit and hard work to discover
the next miracle drug or cure for cancer; it means we have established pathways
and systems that seem to afford people a better life, give everyone every
opportunity to intervene on their own circumstances. It's at base,
[Rawlsian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position). This is a view that
encompasses more than public school systems and their noble (but maybe naive?)
goals to increase intelligence through good developmental environment. There is
a fair amount to dig into and qualify for me, but broadly, it's my starting
position.

What is the point of the fruits we have obtained with building our potential for
flourishing if we don't open up the opportunity to _anyone_ who could benefit
from it? We can, and we should, even if some don't take it. Should we offer
treatment to everyone who suffers from alcoholism, even if they don't take us up
on it? I'll share that I certainly didn't take full advantage of school. In fact
I spectacularly failed out of my first high school and was a terrible student
when I finally got to college. But despite my struggles, I got immense use out
of an eventual degree, the socialization aspects, and the skills that I had to
learn to pass my classes. For all its problems (and there are _many_), the
education system in this country is undeniably a good thing.

## Criticisms on neurobiology as the right path (for now)

Neurobiology is a promising path to intervene on certain conditions that may
contribute to socioeconomic status, intelligence being one among many. Look no
further than SSRIs or Adderall or, the newest miracle drug, semaglutide
(Ozempic), to see what can be achieved. What used to be stigmatized,
misdiagnosed, with sequelae misattributed to all sorts of false proximate causes
(most moral or philosphical instead of medical) is now understood and, better
yet, treated by these interventions.

But critics hold that neurobiology, a more-or-less fledgling field that deals in
hard-to-understand genes and their complex expressions and probabilites, is not
the right thing to concentrate on right now. As mentioned earlier, there is the
gargantuan problem of gene expression and environmental confounds. It is also
true that we have much more to uncover about the actual neurobiological
underpinnings of intelligence. Teasing all of this apart will take a while and
progress has been stuck at a crawl. So, even with the weight of experimental
data suggesting primacy of the genome over the environment, many hold that
poverty reduction is by far the procedurally superior intervention: it's just
simply more practical.

## Morality of intelligence research

It's not hard to see the risks to embracing this research path. It's not a new
argument either: abuse and mistreatment on the grounds of intelligence wouldn't
be the first time humans have attempted such a repugnant political pogrom. We
have a long history of terrible regimes justifying horrible treatment of
populations seen as "inferior". This time, we would really have real, better
data. In ages past (even as recently as the
[20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#After_1945)),
these same arguments were made on the back of a lot of propaganda and completely
unethical, bad science driven by agenda instead of genuine pursuit for truth.

While, in innumerable ways, our world is not the same world as even just a few
decades ago (read one of my favorite
[books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now) ever on it if you don't
believe me), just skimming the current headlines and witnessing the idiocracy
and dumb political beliefs might give you cause for doubting that we can behave
responsibly with knowledge on biological factors of intelligence. Or, your might
even doubt we could use it effectively. I mean, we're still trying to convince
people about basic, evidence-based findings surrounding things like vaccines,
the earth being round, or depression being a much more complicated problem than
a simple personality trait like laziness, for crying out loud. Even modern
intellectuals and researchers are mired in controversy surrounding intelligence;
just google Charles Murray or E.O. Wilson (although I will say, many views are
also frequently misrepresented as saying something they are not).

All of that is to say: the hesitance is, if you ask me, probably one of the most
understandable things, well, ever.

Even so, I would argue the landscape isn't quite the same now. Many, many more
ethical bodies, laws, regulations, guiding medical boards, science
organizations, and even the deep knowledge we have attained (which directly
refutes the morally corrupt claims that figures made in the past) won't _allow_
us to go backwards unless all these relevant parties somehow develop amnesia.
Enlightenment, I am betting (and hoping), is here to stay. It's not a guarantee
that there won't be some crackpot who misrepresents the data to make invidious
arguments, but in my view:

1. That already happens today, both with
   [genetics](<https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(18)30363-X.pdf>) and in
   other arenas. Think race and crime statistics used to justify all manner of
   modern bogus theories, or different prejudices against mental health, sexual
   orientation, etc. We _certainly_ don't want more of it, but it wouldn't
   really introduce a new problem.
2. It seems a safe bet that good morals and science will continue to win out as
   they have over the last couple hundred years.

The key word in point 2 is "continue": good morals and science are what got us
to this more ethical stage of flourishing in the 21st century in the first
place. Life is just plain better than it was even 50 years ago, despite our
current struggles. Call me a naive optimist, but I am just following historical
trends.

As uncomfortable as this subject might be, and as conscientiously as we need to
traverse this field of research, we should remember: at the end of the day,
humans want to improve our circumstances. If we didn't, we'd still be living in
caves (here is
[an awesome read](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11382184-the-optimism-bias)
on the mechanisms behind this penchant for improvement). _Everyone_ would take a
pill to magically improve their circumstances that inform wellbeing, with
intelligently navigating life being one such informant. We have been bending the
universe, securing flourishing for us and our descendents for hundreds of
thousands of years. This yearning for knowledge and the repudiation of stagnancy
is at the basis of, well, pretty much _all_ scientific endeavor, the genesis of
which is the Englightenment. The benefit of SSRIs, cancer treatements and other
physical and societal interventions are, to a one, borne of the will to improve
our unplanned genetic and environmental lotteries. Therefore, improving
understanding of biological and genetic bases for intelligence is an extension
of improving understanding of biological and genetic bases for depression,
cancer and other ailments and physical conditions outside of our control.

The moral argument is quite simply: intervene if we can. If poverty or
near-poverty has some of its roots in neurobiology beyond anyone's control, it
is _right and just_ to impede on it. We should want to toss out the chaotic,
primordial genetic soup that birthed our species; its expiration date has
passed. Instead, let us adjust this soup's recipe to an impactful genetic broth
with maximal potential.

Suffering only absolves itself of necessity with knowledge.
