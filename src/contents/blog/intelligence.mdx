Yes, the above quote is from _that_ Ronald Reagan. Oh, how far we have fallen,
eh?

The accelerating pace of neuroscience in the last few decades has yielded
extraordinary insights into the nature of human intelligence. What was once the
exclusive domain of philosophical conjecture—questions about the source,
stability, and limits of human cognition—has now become increasingly susceptible
to empirical inquiry. Advances in neuroimaging, psychometrics, and genetics have
fueled this shift, overturning many of our long-held intuitions about the mind
and its potential. And yet, our discourse—both scientific and public—has failed
to fully integrate these findings, leaving us in a state of moral and political
dissonance.

Recently, I read _The Neuroscience of Intelligence_ (part of the Cambridge
series of neuroscience of psychology) by Richard Haier of the University of
California, Irvine. A sweeping overview of the landscape of intelligence in
neuroscience (duh), the pages are absolutely crammed full with experiments,
explanations, data, interpretations, and theory; it's a lot to take in. Several
of my moral and philosophical presuppositions—those of intelligence, social
outcomes, and the malleability of individual potential—were exposed.
Unsurprisingly, when I think about it, the book augmented
[some other views](https://emackinnon.io/blog/determinism) I have. Reexamination
of assumptions is rarely a waste of time, however.

It is no small thing to realize that much of what we consider solvable through
intervention may, in fact, be underwritten by a genetic architecture far more
resistant to change than we had hoped. The implications are profound. If the
boundaries of intelligence are more constrained than commonly thought, it may be
that we need to rescope our ambitions for public policy and social programs. The
prevailing assumption has been that, with the right combination of investments
in education and social opportunity we can significantly uplift cognitive
outcomes across populations. To be clear, this is _mostly_ an examination of
_Tabula rasa_ theories, but I will flirt a bit with politics. Hopefully my
positions are rational enough to be acceptable and worth thinking about, even if
you disagree on various levels.

# PFIT (Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory)

The core of Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory proposes that there are a number
of regions in the brain that underlie intelligent behavior and there is a clear,
structured flow, form and function. Imaging research, lesion studies, and
psychometrics provide the multidimensional evidence supporting PFIT. Sensory
data percolates through the parietal lobe and is elaborated on by the frontal
lobe, with interactions between the two generating evaluations and calculations
and the anterior cingulate cortex playing a role in inhibiting or promoting
responses. There is a general consensus that the PFIT is seen as the "best
available answer" to the question of "where" in the brain intelligence resides,
with a hint of "how" intelligence works.

Haier's overview teases out a few key concepts:

## Structure and Function

Intelligence is a physical, specifically biological, phenomenon. Variance in
intelligence is strongly linked to brain structures like gray matter, cortical
thickness, efficiency, and white matter integrity. Intelligence can be measured
relatively well through psychometrics or chronometrics and is individually
stable. While measurements of intelligence remain stable, under nuanced
circumstances like learning new skills, it may be _moderately_ improved in some
areas. Less activity, in some regions and under some circumstances, correlates
to higher IQs in many cases (again, with nuance), suggesting that efficient
networks play a part in intelligence. These metrics strongly predict outcomes
like school achievements and socioeconomic status (however, there is much to dig
into and many confounds to address with that correlation).

## Genes' Major Role

Genes and gene expression, not environment, overwhelmingly drive variance in
intelligence. While the genes-to-intelligence relationship remains controversial
politically, it is not so scientifically. We will benefit from redressing valid
concerns given past historical misuses, terrible ethics of intelligence research
and treatment of disadvantaged research subjects. The most compelling evidence
for genes' dominant role is studies on identical twins raised apart and children
raised in different homes from their parents. These frameworks of experiment
(twin, adoption and sibling) are considered a gold standard for gene and gene
expression studies. The correlation coefficient of intelligence is about 77%,
having been replicated time and time again with increasingly large population
studies. Despite the ongoing failure to identify even a single gene as one that
is _definitively_ responsible for differences in intelligence, Haier relays that
intelligence is suspected by many to be pleiotropic (one intelligence gene could
affect many dissimilar traits) and broadly accepted as polygenic (many genes
contribute in a lot of small ways to overall intelligence). Epigenetic variances
remain a wrinkle to unravel, but even so, it is clear that environment is
operating on the biological material it has at hand.

## Environment's Relevance

The same studies that point to genes' influence also point to environment
playing a role, but the role is nuanced. Nutrition, stable learning
environments, and socioeconomic status all influence cognitive development.
Early on, differences in environment account for a high percentage of
differences in intelligence (around 75% at age 5!), but this drops to less 20
percent by age 18. Environment platforms development, but its reach is weaker
than once believed. Early interventions, such as heavy investment in childhood
programs aimed at raising latent ability (with the most obvious outcome being
higher test scores), have yielded tepid and limited results. With more
understanding of the biological substrate of intelligence, this could change.
Worth mentioning is the
[Flynn effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect), an unresolved
phenomenon. This is certainly worth finding causal factors of, but as of yet, it
doesn't refute the genetic/biological evidence. Likely, it simply reinforces the
first and second sentences of this paragraph.

## Enhancement is Limited

So far, putative intelligence improvement through brain-training and enhancement
abilities are limited, despite a robust industry built around this premise.
While it was hoped that we might find low cost, low effort interventions like
memory training or listening to Mozart, many experimental results have only
offered modest but temporary improvements at best, and simply even left the
realm of statistical standard error at worst. Researchers have shifted their
hopes toward biological interventions, with some extremely interesting pathways
in development. Check out
[DREADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_activated_solely_by_a_synthetic_ligand)
(classes of synthetic, engineered neuronal receptors that are activated and
inhibited through corresponding synthetic neurotransmitters) or
[optogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics) (activating and
inhibiting neurons and cells with light), to get tantalizing glimpses of a
future where brain function can be modified with precision. But for now, the
genetic architecture of intelligence remains remarkably stubborn.

## Neuroscience Could and Should Inform Policy

Intelligence and socioeconomic factors are deeply intertwined at the
neurological level. Intelligence has a heritable component, but gene expression
is influenced by environmental factors, making it hard to attribute causal
direction in phenotypical traits of intelligence. Variance in intelligence
centers around many of the same neurological structures that socioeconomic
status (SES) tends to affect. For example: Lower SES is often associated with
chronic stress (e.g., financial instability, food insecurity, exposure to
violence). Chronic stress leads to dysregulation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and increased cortisol levels, which
negatively impact brain structures like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
These same brain regions are crucial for cognitive function and intelligence,
meaning that SES-related stress can influence cognitive abilities, profoundly
blurring our understanding. Haier argues that insight into the neuroscience of
intelligence will lead to better interventions on early childhood education
leading to maximized potentials.

# Genetics and the Limits of Malleability

I had a few of my assumptions disquietly rattled by Haier's summation of the
state of research. Familiar to me was that genes and their expression are the
supreme governors of our individual conditions, but _unfamiliar_ to me was how
rigid intelligence is proving to be despite variance in environment. It seems we
have fewer broad levers at our disposal than has been impressed upon me by the
political conversations of our era. At least, levers besides the basics of
nutrition, stress and poverty.

To be honest, all of this probably should not have been too much of a surprise
given findings like the
[ceiling](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7243589/#:~:text=Abstract,fixed%20limit%20to%20longevity%20too)
we seem to have hit with longevity. If you have read one of my all time favorite
books in the world ever,
[Behave](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31170723-behave) by Robert
Sapolsky, it's even less of a surprise. Physical systems have rules and
boundaries, and while there is wiggle room, eventually you have to intervene on
the system itself to make changes. There is a difference between _realizing
potential_ and _enhancing potential_.

In case it is still a bit fuzzy (because, let's be honest, heritability can be
freaking confusing), we should hash out the finer points of the age-old "genes
vs environment" debate.

Imagine you are in a competition. You are going to build a life-sized replica of
the Sistine Chapel, heavenly ceiling and all, and will be scored on accuracy.
The accuracy score of the replica can represent intelligence scores. The art
supplies (clay, marble, sculpting tools, paint, paint brushes) you have
represent one's genome. Your creativity represents the environmental forces
brought to bear on the material art supplies. As is plain to see, accuracy
scores boil down to some combination of the quality and condition of supplies
(genes) you possess and your creative ability (environment). If you really want
to fill out the analogy, the way your creativity _influences how you use the
supplies themselves_ (maybe you modify the brush to result in a better paint
stroke or use a supply in an extremely unconventional way), might be something
like epigenetics, but we can leave that notion to one side for now.

You might see how, even if you aren't entirely sure that it's a 50/50 split
between art supplies and creativity that determines accuracy score, you could
form some questions to figure it out:

> How well would an IRS tax accountant, with all the creativity of a wooden
> board, do with all the best art supplies?
>
> How accurate could Picasso be with a single can of gray paint and some
> dried-out Play-Doh from the 80s?
>
> Are accuracy scores more beholden to one factor or the other?
>
> Does a bad set of art supplies carry a higher risk of inaccuracy than a lack
> of creativity?

Imagine a genetically gifted individual raised in poverty, without access to
formal education, proper nutrition, or social stability. Such a person may fail
to fully express their cognitive potential. But—and this is crucial—providing
them with optimal conditions does not increase their genetic ceiling; it merely
allows them to approach it. The inverse is also true: placing an individual with
modest genetic endowment into ideal conditions will not produce brilliance. This
asymmetry reveals a troubling truth—public policy can mitigate cognitive
underdevelopment, but it cannot manufacture genius. _Tabula rasa_ and similar
theories attempt to achieve neurobiological Alchemy.

With a pile of shitty art supplies, Picasso may approach the high accuracy
scores more successfully than the uninspired IRS accountant would (this would
analogize to an improvement in environment), but the set of supplies is
assymetrically restrictive on accuracy score.

We are all aware that our body's parameters are foisted upon us: your muscle
size, physical health and metabolism have individually limited ranges. Do all
the bicep curls you want, but the upper limit of your arm muscles' size is
determined not by how many you do, but by how muscular your parents' and
grandparents' biceps were. Mental health is an abstraction of the physical, so
too does it come with limits: we all have our genetic predispositions. It is no
coincidence that the explosion of effective and dynamic interventions for
entrenched mental health problems were not during remedial Freudian or Jungian
psychoanalytic and psychodynamic theories' peak in popularity, but instead at
the advent of systemic _physical_ interventions (caveat: therapy _can_ be
effective, but therapy is _also_ a
[path to changing physical processes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4920136/)
in the brain).

These facts have serious implications for the way we think about educational
spending, social welfare, and upward mobility. If intelligence is predominantly
genetic, then our capacity to create a society of uniformly high performers rich
in ability is fundamentally constrained. To nip both the respective typical
conservative and typical liberal arguments in the bud: it is not merely a
question of will or program investment. It is a question of biology.

# Public Policy Implications

I tend to be in favor of building and preserving common-sense public goods,
utilizing public intervention when we can make a good case for it. Providing
pathways for education is a no-brainer, but I was under the impression that the
social reactionary arguments to heavy genetic influence on intelligence had it
_mostly_ correct: I thought, blithely, that sending my kids to good schools will
dictate their cleverness and success. To be honest, knowing how much I struggled
in school (for a number of reasons, I spectacularly failed out of my first high
school and barely made it through university), it is a deeply disconcerting
notion that those stages of my own life might be in some sense chained to my
predispositions. Quite often wonder: just how tightly coupled were those events?
What factor would have changed my trajectory, if any? Naturally, a question like
that leads me to worry about what I might pass on to my own children.

In the middle of this book I had a small crisis: Do many of our cherished social
policies rest on fiction? Even if we can intervene on intelligence in the
future, what is the point of good education systems _now_ if we can never break
the upper limit of our custom, genetically-configured intelligence? In other
words, if the best we can hope for is that by going to school you meet your full
genetically-bound potential, but not exceed or improve on it, then why dump
public money into a school system that won't ever do what it sets out to do:
fundamentally increase ability? Are we doing the equivalent of sending everyone
to the NFL combine and expecting Tom Bradys across the board?

While I will admit I hadn’t explicitly considered the relationship between
school systems, neurobiology, and outcomes, my cursory notions now seem, at
best, naive. I am not sure I would have called myself a subscriber to "Blank
Slate" Theories (Steven Pinker
[argued compellingly against it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate)
and related social theories, explaining some of the social campaigns in certain
fields of research), but I certainly thought the split between genes and
environment was closer to 50/50 than the roughly 80/20 split the data suggests
it to be. I thought overhauling school systems, a not-so-uncommon political idea
with various attempts at execution over the years, was a legitimate, effective,
and simple solution (at least, relative to biological solutions) for getting
everyone into a higher economic class, potentiating success, and encouraging
individual achievement.

Let me be clear: quite obviously, schooling and other early childhood
development programs offer far more than just presumed intelligence gains. They
benefit participants by providing opportunities for socialization, athletics,
nutrition (in some cases, very, _very_ sadly, the best a child will get all
week), novel experiences, and relief for overextended parents, among other
things. It's a long list that justifies itself many times over. And, even if
good early childhood development platforms simply allow realization instead of
revolution of ability, that's another boon to add to the list. Fulfillment of
potential is a worthy goal.

To touch on my own political views: I think society has a moral imperative to
provide resources for those who, through no fault of their own (because who in
the flying f\*\*k chooses to be disadvantaged by poverty or other debilitating
hardships and conditions?) to provide platforms and opportunities for increases
in socioeconomic status, leaving as few of our fellow humans behind as we can.
Note: when I said "society has a moral imperative", by "society" I specifically
mean government and the public institutions it presides over; there is no other
entity to perform this function at the margins. The state protects and serves
those that markets don't.

None of this is mutually exclusive needing skills, merit, and hard work to
discover the next miracle drug or cure for cancer — it simply shows we’ve
established clear pathways and systems (school, access to healthcare, good
employment, and income) that afford people a better life. We should give
everyone every opportunity to intervene on their own circumstances. It's, at
base, a [Rawlsian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position) framework,
and yes, I am aware that it's easier to hold 10,000 feet high moral views and
much harder to form legislation and policy around them.

Better understanding leads to better interventions leads to better policy leads
to better lives and better human flourishing. It's a straightforward formula.

# Public Policy Dilemmas

Neurobiology offers a promising path to intervene on certain conditions that
contribute to socioeconomic status, with intelligence being one among many. Look
no further than SSRIs or Adderall or, the newest miracle drug, semaglutide
(Ozempic), to see what can be provisionally achieved. What used to be
stigmatized, misdiagnosed, with sequelae misattributed to all sorts of false
proximate causes (most of them moral or philosphical "shortcomings" instead of
medical or physical prognoses) is now understood and, better yet, treated by
these interventions.

But critics hold that neurobiology, a somewhat fledgling field, which deals in
hard-to-understand genes, their complex expressions and probabilites of
outcomes, is not the right thing to concentrate on right now—it doesn't yet
scale to public policy. As mentioned earlier, there is the gargantuan problem of
an intelligence and SES confound. Couple that with how much more we have to
understand the neurobiological underpinnings of intelligence and the years we
have ahead of us trying to tease it apart (at our current snail’s pace), and it
feels daunting. So, even with overwhelming experimental data suggesting the
genome’s primacy over environment, poverty reduction remains the procedurally
superior intervention: it's just simply more practical in many people's eyes. I
certainly see their point.

# The Discomfort of Morality

It's not hard to see the risks to embracing this research path. History has
witnessed innumerable
[appalling and morally corrupt abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#After_1945)
of intelligence research—eugenics, forced sterilizations, and systemic
discrimination against perceived "inferior" populations. We must disentangle the
truth of intelligence from the crimes committed in its name.

While, in innumerable ways, our world is a better world than even a few short
decades ago(read one of my favorite
[books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now) ever on it if you don't
believe me), just skimming the current headlines and witnessing the idiocracy,
dumb political beliefs and
[alarming new political movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment)
might give you cause for doubting that we can behave responsibly with knowledge
on biological factors of intelligence. Or, you might even distrust our ability
use whatever comes of such knowledge effectively. I mean, we're still trying to
convince people about basic, evidence-based findings surrounding things like
vaccines, the earth being round, or depression being a much more complicated
problem than a simple personality trait like laziness, for crying out loud. Even
modern intellectuals and researchers are mired in controversy surrounding
intelligence-just google Charles Murray or E.O. Wilson. Although, as an aside:
people frequently misrepresent many of these researchers’ views, and the current
state of research, as summarized by Haier, suggests we should lower the
pitchforks, suppress our gag reflex, and have a real conversation about the
data.

And if all of doesn't give you pause... we can talk about the elephant in the
room: the current administration has made anti-intellectualism and scoffing at
expert, scientific opinion a calling card. They have mangled, misrepresented and
bastardized the specifics of certain research projects funded by the government
in order to make them sound so ridiculous as to deride science _in general_ or
use it to shove politics
[down our throats](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/states-push-fight-against-mrna-vaccines)
(although liberal politics rendered their own problems in academia). The admin
has pulled valuable funding from the NIH and other institutes, some of _the_
most productive and prestigious scientific institutes in the world, seemingly
unaware or uncaring of the fact that government funding is responsible for some
of the best [scientific projects](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project)
and discoveries in our lifetimes. The sheer irresponsibility with injecting this
brand of politics into 21st century science is enough to make you want to pack
up all your shit, buy a boat, scream the lyrics to N.W.A.'s most
[enduring hit](https://open.spotify.com/intl-de/track/5n8Aro6j1bEGIy7Tpo7FV7),
and risk attempting to join the Sentinal Islanders in their isolation.

All of the above is to say: the hesitance is, if you ask me, probably one of the
most understandable things, well, ever. We live in a world that platforms some
breathtakingly stupid ideas.

Even so, I would argue there is good reason to hope we might be alright. Many,
many more ethical bodies, laws, regulations, guiding medical boards, good
science organizations, and even the deep knowledge we have attained (which
directly refutes the morally corrupt claims made in times past) won't _allow_ us
to retreat backwards unless all these relevant parties and organizations somehow
develop amnesia, forget their purpose and toss our moral progress to the winds.
Enlightenment, I am betting (and hoping), is here to stay, even if it gets lost
in the details of daily headlines. It's not a guarantee that there won't be some
crackpot who misrepresents the data to make invidious arguments, but in my view:

- That already happens today, both with
  [genetics](<https://www.cell.com/ajhg/pdf/S0002-9297(18)30363-X.pdf>) and in
  other arenas. Think race and crime statistics used to justify all manner of
  modern bogus theories, or different prejudices against mental health, sexual
  orientation, etc. We _certainly_ don't want more of it, but it wouldn't really
  introduce a new problem.
- It seems a safe bet that good morals and science will continue to win out as
  they have over the last couple hundred years.

The key word in bullet point 2 is "continue": good morals and science are what
got us to this more ethical stage of flourishing in the 21st century in the
first place. Better morals have better purchase and life is just plain better
than it was even 50 years ago, despite our current struggles. Call me a naive
optimist, but I am just following historical trends.

As uncomfortable as this subject might be, and as conscientiously as we need to
traverse this field of research, we should remember: at the end of the day,
humans want to improve our circumstances. If we didn't, we'd still be living in
caves (here is
[an awesome read](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11382184-the-optimism-bias)
on the mechanisms behind this penchant for improvement) and it is, quite
objectively, a good thing we are not still in caves. _Everyone_ would take a
pill to magically improve their circumstances that inform wellbeing, with
intelligently navigating life being one such informant. We have been bending the
universe, securing flourishing for ourselves and our descendents for hundreds of
thousands of years. This yearning for knowledge and the repudiation of stagnancy
is at the basis of, well, pretty much _all_ scientific endeavor, the genesis of
which is the Englightenment. The benefit of SSRIs, cancer treatements and other
physical and societal interventions are, to a one, borne of the will to improve
our unconsenting participation in genetic and environmental lotteries.

The overarching moral argument here is simple: intervene if we can.

We do not hesitate to treat depression with SSRIs, cancer with chemotherapy, or
diabetes with insulin. And yet, when it comes to intelligence—a variable as
biologically grounded as any other—our moral inhibitions remain paralyzing. But
the logic is no different: if cognitive capacity profoundly influences life
outcomes, then improving cognitive capacity—whether through genetic engineering,
the proximate environmental causes of expression or other neurobiological
intervention—is as morally urgent as treating any other condition that
diminishes human flourishing. Poverty, educational failure, chronic
unemployment—these are not merely social failings but poorly understood
neurobiological ones. Read that sentence again if you attribute failings mainly
to simplistic phenomena like laziness or individual will. As I have laid out
[before](https://emackinnon.io/blog/determinism), once neurobiology is invited
to stand under the eaves of morality and philosophy, it should profoundly shift
our ontological foundations.

The question is not only one dealing with human potential: it is one dealing
with suffering. Suffering only absolves itself of necessity with knowledge and
progress.

We should want to toss out the chaotic, primordial genetic soup that birthed our
species; its expiration date has passed. Instead, let us adjust this soup's
recipe to an impactful genetic broth with maximal potential.
