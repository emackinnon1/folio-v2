# Logic of Time

I love logic.

Despite hating math during my formative school years and not having much of a formal education in logic, it's one of my favorite subjects. I know I will never be a genius
on the matter, but I nonetheless stoked a late-blossoming passion for it after transferring over to a career in writing it as a software developer. I even have a few
tattoos of logic proofs and problems: [Fitch's Paradox of Knowability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch%27s_paradox_of_knowability),
[Moore's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_paradox), and [Moore's "Here is one hand" argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_is_one_hand).
