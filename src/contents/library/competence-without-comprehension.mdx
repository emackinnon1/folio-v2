# Inversions of reasoning

Daniel Dennett's _From Bacteria to Bach and Back_ is a whirlwind.

It will shock you with its ideas baked in the sheer austerity of Dennett's clear thought and comprehensive arguments. The
span of subject is wide; Dennett glides and skates across a thousand aspects of the _why_ and _how_ of the human mind
with a penchant for pulling in fields like computer science and evolutionary biology to illustrate his ideas.

One of the glittering gems mined from the book is the idea of "comprehension without competence". An inversion of top-down
design of the kind a computer programmer might be familiar with, it emerges gradually with no plan.
