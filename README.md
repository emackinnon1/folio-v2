## Project Setup ðŸ”§

If you want to set up the project locally, feel free to follow these steps:

First, fork the repo, then:

```sh
git clone <your-fork>
cd ./theodorusclarence.com

# Copy the .env.example to .env.local
#   most features are turned off by default
#   so you won't need to add any envs
cp .env.example .env.local

# Install the dependencies
pnpm

# Run the development server
pnpm dev
```

You can now open up `http://localhost:3000` and start writing code!

## Feature Flag

Major features are feature flagged in [constants/env.ts](https://github.com/emackinnon1/folio-v2/blob/main/src/constants/env.ts)

For example:

```ts
/**
 * Show command service on contents
 * @see Comment.tsx
 */
export const commentFlag = isProd;
```

## Format ðŸ’…

When writing your code, please try to follow the existing code style.

Your code will be automatically linted and formatted before each commit. However, if you want to manually lint and format, use the provided pnpm scripts.

```sh
pnpm lint:fix
pnpm format
```

You also have to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for the commit message.
